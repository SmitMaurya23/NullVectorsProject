The Cause for the Beatification of Sister Faustina was re-inroduced in 1978 by Karol Wojtyla - then Archbishop of Cracow (Krakow - in Polish) - now Pope John Paul II who spoked to UGO FESTA, whose miraculous cure is featured in this video.

Our journey will give a basic grasp of God's sovereign hand behind the history of our nation, which our founding fathers so clearly understood. The result of this journey will give us a better understanding of where America is today, how she arrived here, and where she must turn at this critical hour. For as Thomas Jefferson once asked, \"Can the liberties of a nation be secure, when we have removed the conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\"", "\"A NATION ADRIFT is an excellent video for anyone wanting to know the truth about the rich history and heritage of this nation.\" -- <i>Jim Woodall, Vice President, Concerned Women For America</i><br /><br />\"A NATION ADRIFT offers a perspective on the Christian premises of American liberty which has been obscured for too many years in the government schools at all levels. I am confident that, if every American took the time to view A NATION ADRIFT, it would have a history-changing impact on our nation's course.\" -- <i>Howard Phillips, Chairman U.S. Taxpayers Alliance</i><br /><br />\"A NATION ADRIFT should be viewed in churches, homes, and schools across the nation. This video illustrates how the forces of humanism have attacked America's foundation of faith.\" -- <i>Don Wildmon, President, American Family Association</i><br /><br />\"I'm always looking for videos to use to help tell Americans what is truth or fact in this country and A NATION ADRIFT is one of the finest that's ever been produced...the finest in content and the finest in technical quality. You need to get A NATION ADRIFT for you and your family, children, grandchildren, church, youth group, and it will help you counteract some of the revisionist history that's being taught in the schools and colleges of the United States.\" -- <i>Marlin Maddoux, Radio Talk Show Host</i><br /><br />\"Since the Christian basis of so much of American history has been deleted or rewritten, A NATION ADRIFT is an answer to our yearnings! Though rich with a great number and variety of visuals, the video's strongest point is that, in only 90 minutes, a viewer can see and hear enough new and significant information to all but obviate the need to even take a U.S. history class! Every American should see this video because it contains information that will probably never again be presented in the secular classrooms of this \"nation adrift.\" -- <i>Dale Mason, Gospel Communications</i><br /><br />\"This video has a vital and timely message for Americans. With its excellent production techniques, I expect it to have a major impact on audiences wherever it is shown.\" -- <i>D. James Kennedy, Ph.D., Coral Ridge Ministries</i><br /><br />A NATION ADRIFT is an excellent video presentation of the moral and spiritual crisis in America and the urgent necessity of recovering the truth about America's Christian heritage and God's plan for our nation. It is a call to action for America's Christians for pleading with God to bring a revival before it is too late.\" -- <i>Peter Marshall, Author and Historian</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "A NATION ADRIFT  A Chronicle of America's Providential Heritage VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Tom Kane", "feature": [], "rank": "496,880 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$16.99", "asin": "0005092663", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

The ebb and flow of the ocean waves and tides and the changing of the seasons provide predictable rhythm and regularity to the created order, yet they are also full of infinite variety and beauty.

Only God can bring true and lasting transformation to our lives. But there are practices that we can develop and maintain in our lives that keep us open and available to the power of God.

That's just the sort of world-weary 8-year-old aardvark he is. Nevertheless, he and his pals are hopeful that this year, even though it's already the 22nd and there's no snow on the ground, heavy-duty wish fulfillment, or at least a good time, will be had by all. Well-heeled classmate Muffy is hard at work on the good time part, but she's too busy broadcasting the news of her pull-out-all-the-stops party to pay attention when the increasingly frustrated Francine begs off because of Hanukkah commitments. Buster Baxter, meanwhile, has his hands full getting his guilt-ridden divorced mom to mellow out. And Arthur's knee-deep in his own predicaments: DW demands he draft the perfect letter to Santa; his dad deserts the annual turkey in favor of a historically correct Christmas dinner; and he feels like a dufus, as he puts it, when, on Christmas morning, he drops and breaks the perfect present he bought for his mother. Fortunately, there's nothing a few well-chosen words from a grownup like his Uncle Fred can't fix, and the others also finagle a way around their differences--the holiday spirit sneaks up and smiles on everybody. The one-hour video is pleasantly paced and gets extra spice from a handful of original songs and a few far-fetched, genuinely funny Arthur fantasy segments. Guaranteed to make any <I>Arthur</I> fan's spirits bright. <I>--Tammy La Gorce</I>", "In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, plans are underway in Elwood City for the best holidays ever! Arthur, D.W., their friends and family make preparations for perfect gifts, perfect parties, and perfect family traditions for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanza. But, just as in real life, perfection cannot last and things begin to fall apart.

Children as young as 18 months will bounce happily along with the catchy tunes, and 2-year-olds will be inspired to count aloud with Ernie. Kids up to age 5 will hone their counting skills and laugh at the increasingly frustrated Benny as he delivers everything from 1 bucket of ice to 15 stampeding elephants!

Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything from <I>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</I> to <I>Bonnie and Clyde</I>, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Take the Money and Run VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "", "feature": [], "rank": "388,918 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$14.95", "asin": "0764003828", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Robson Green stars as Dave Creegan, the haunted, tightly wrapped investigator whose forehead scar is a constant reminder of his near-death experience. In <I>Touching Evil 2</I> the Organized and Serial Crime Unit (a fictional police division roughly equivalent to the American FBI) investigates three new cases: a flamboyant serial killer whose murders continue after he's been captured, a wave of relief workers found dead and wrapped in white shrouds, and a baby-broker with ties to a notorious ring of pedophiles. What gives the series its grit is the toll each case takes on the cops. Creegan's confidence is shattered when a miscalculation leaves a girl dead and that misstep haunts him to the devastating series finale. His partner Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker) finds the line between her personal life and her cases blur, and junior squad member Mark Rivers (Shaun Dingwell) goes through a tormenting trial by fire--and trial under fire--to prove his courage and his competence to the unit and to himself.

Ioan Gruffudd plays the adult Pip, an orphan who lives with his sister and her kindly blacksmith husband. Pip's life changes when he is sent for by Miss Haversham (Charlotte Rampling), an eccentric and wealthy spinster who wears only her bridal gown, which she was wearing when she was left at the altar years before. Introduced to Estella (played later as a woman by Justine Waddell), Miss Haversham's contemptuous ward, Pip falls in love with the girl and spends the remainder of his youth attempting to be good enough for her--a state of affairs that suddenly seems possible when a mysterious benefactor makes Pip's education as a London gentleman possible. Gruffudd is a fine choice for the central character, and his naturally intense expression underscores Pip's problems with insecurity and sense of deservedness. Waddell is an appropriately solipsistic Estella, slightly reminiscent of Vivien Leigh, and Rampling's casting is an unexpected but terrific move on the filmmaker's part. The veteran actress's career-long air of mystery, vague suffering, and intense sexuality bring a potent power to Miss Haversham's baleful looks.

Go behind the legend and discover a man who lived in a world much like our own, filled with violence and upheaval. A man who played many roles: wealthy lothario, soldier, businessman, preacher, defender of the poor, and a rebel who never hesitated to speak the truth to the powerful. Narrated by Liev Schreiber (The Manchurian Candidate) with Robert Sean Leonard (House, M.D., The Dead Poets Society) as the voice of Francis and based on the biography of St. Francis by best-selling author Donald Spoto.\n\nPatrick\nFew historical figures inspire more celebration than Irelands St. Patrick. Many believe him to have been an Irishman who drove the snakes from Ireland, but neither is true. Patrick offers a dramatic new look at one of the best-loved and least-understood icons of world religion. The story of the real St. Patrick is part adventure tale and part spiritual awakening, with the future saint rising from slave to liberator; learning to forgive and ultimately love his enemies; taking up a cause no one believed in; and finally lighting a fire that kept western civilization alive.

Embittered by an uncaring Catholic church and by the absence of their irresponsible father, they lived with their hardy but chronically depressed mother with an equal blend of abject misery and joyful adventure.

Which is to say that the era that set the stage for the obviously upheaval-heavy '60s is getting its own undressing, and the interlocutors are finding all sorts of fascinating stuff. Historian David Halberstam, who logged time in the era as a journalist and civil rights struggle participant, helped nudge the era's current popularity with his <a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449909336/${0}\">book</a>, which gives this exhaustive six-tape series its name.

From its coverage of the McCarthy era and the baby boom to its study of the growth of affluence as a national ideal, the set roots many of its themes through the ways 1950s culture came together as a visual spectacle. First there is television ad-mogul Rosser Reeves and the leveraging of the television as a sales machine, then there's Richard Nixon's first career salvage job via television, then there are the running visual (and literary) constructions and interrogations of domesticity, and much more. Also prevalent in the set, though, is the concurrent rise of the \"men's magazine\" (i.e., <I>Playboy</I>), the then-alluring first edition of the <I>Kinsey Report</I>, and the spread of a manifest culture of desire--which in writing sounds amply intellectual but in viewing is fast-paced, compelling, and easy to engage for long periods of time. Probably most compelling in the set is the way the era's visuals changed society irrevocably--and swiftly. The civil rights era's catapult was due in large part to general citizenry witnessing fire hoses and police dogs trained on children and the astonishing power of Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent resistance. On another level, the visuals also created both a dizzying array of styles, captured here in regard to automobile manufacturers, and the flattening of one style into a <I>de facto</I> standard, captured here in the spreading communist fear, the rise of McDonald's restaurants, and even Elvis Presley. This series is the best up-close focus on the 1950s, making it essential to students of American culture, general history fans, and anyone curious about the tendrils of culture in the United States. <I>--Andrew Bartlett</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "David Halberstam's the Fifties VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Edward Herrmann", "feature": [], "rank": "208,837 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["0449909336", "B00PHD6FQ8"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$26.00", "asin": "0767004132", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

The masses of these non-English-speaking immigrants survived and ultimately overcame language barriers, negative stereotypes, and prejudice that first put them at the bottom of the urban pecking order. What is most revealing about this documentary is not necessarily the superficial story of Italian immigrants, in which the basic plot of homeland desertion, poverty, discrimination, and triumph are common elements in other immigrant communities. What it adeptly points out, though, is that the Italians were often the community to do things first, best, and biggest, thus integrating Italian culture inextricably into American culture. It divides Italian-American history into several sociological events including the largest mass exodus into the United States in history, the first successful labor unions, the rise of the largest organized crime families (which is refreshingly downplayed), the importance of the tight Italian family, the rise of Italian movie stars, singers, and athletes, and of course the food.

The familiar contours of Bronte's story are all here: Jane, the unhappy orphan, grows up to become governess at Thornfield, a gloomy estate owned by the imperious and worldly, but curiously desperate, Mr. Rochester (Ciarn Hinds). While the latter's grasping attentions stir the inexperienced young woman, the gothic goings-on at Thornfield suggest layers of unwholesome secrecy in Rochester's life.

One of the best- known, best-loved characters of the mystery genre-and the hero of seventy-two novels written by Mr. Stout between 1934 and 1975Nero Wolfe, is the eccentric, ingenious detective who always solves the crime. In this first episode to be adapted from the \"Nero Wolfe\" canon, Nero relentlessly pursues a ruthless murderer on a serial path. His only lead? A reckless car. Famous for keeping his cool, Nero leaves the legwork to his hard- working and bemused assistant, Archie Goodwin. But when Archie and the police are totally stumped, Nero swoops in to solve the endless string of mysteries. Eventually the sleuthing duo zero in on a mysterious woman with golden spider earringsand a riveting trail of clues. Starring Maury Chaykin (\"Entrapment\") as the unflappable Nero Wolfe and Oscar-winner, Timothy Hutton (\"Ordinary People\") as his assistant, Archie Goodwin, THE GOLDEN SPIDERS features a series of mysterious murders, a fascinating gallery of suspects, and a crafty summation by Wolfe that once again pins the murderer to the crime.", "Rex Stout's famous rotund detective, Nero Wolfe, who solves mysteries without leaving his New York brownstone mansion, has once again been reborn.

One such interruption, a street urchin with the fantastic story of a woman wearing garish gold spider earrings held at gunpoint in a car, warrants little more than routine inquiries until the boy is murdered, run down by the same car. The outraged Archie (Timothy Hutton), Wolfe's legman and personal secretary, goads the leery investigator into taking the case. The plot is a tangle of illegal aliens and blackmail with a little murder on the side, but a sense of camaraderie keeps the film humming. Chaykin is a marvelous Wolfe, wry, prickly, and fussy with a shrewd sense of character, while Hutton's Archie is a smart-talking con man with a heart, all natty patter and cocky demeanor lifted right out of an old-time newspaper movie.

December 17, 1776. Hounded by superior British forces, his army decimated by disease, desertion and lack of funds, General George Washington faces the unthinkable: he is losing the war for American independence. A week later, on Christmas Eve, Washington will embark on one of the most profound gambles in military history. Staking everything on a fantastically risky surprise attack against a garrison of battle-hardened Hessian mercenaries, Washington sets out across the ice-choked Delaware River -- into a desperate confrontation in which his career, his life and the American Revolution itself all hang in the balance concluding into one of the greatest victories of all time.", "Every American knows that George Washington crossed the icy Delaware River in the War of Independence, if only from Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's famous 1851 painting. The made-for-cable-TV historical drama <I>The Crossing</I>, scripted by Howard Fast from his novel, corrects at least one piece of historical invention--Washington did not stand and pose for the occasion of Leutze's portrait--but, more importantly, it frames the event in the real-life drama that made it a decisive moment of American history. Jeff Daniels makes a fine General George Washington, the quiet, dignified, and increasingly desperate leader of the volunteer Continental Army. By December 1776, six months after the Declaration of Independence was signed, the tired and hungry army had retreated to the far banks of the Delaware River, a mere fraction of the original 20,000-strong force. Knowing that defeat means the end of the revolution, Washington takes the offensive in a dangerous surprise attack that turns the tide of the war. Like the sprawling Civil War epic <I>Gettysburg</I>, <I>The Crossing</I> takes one incident of the Revolutionary War and digs into the whys and wherefores that make it vital history. It lacks scope and spectacle--major battles appear more like modest skirmishes--and lapses into patriotic fervor at times, but it brims with rich historical detail and comes alive with the stories of officers, soldiers, and a very human George Washington. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Crossing VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Jeff Daniels", "feature": [], "rank": "358,780 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$13.99", "asin": "0767023765", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

In a career that spanned half a century, he penned some of the most recognizable and enduring songs of all time. Jerome Kern may have said it best: \"Irving Berlin has no place in American music--he is American music.\" Incredibly, the composer of classics like \"Cheek to Cheek,\" God Bless America\" and \"White Christmas\" never learned to read music. But that didn't stop an astonishing 35 of his compositions from reaching the number one spot on the charts. Filled with wonderful music, illuminating photos and rare clips from throughout his life, this is a fascinating portrait of the legendary composer. From his childhood on New York City's Lower East Side to his hundredth birthday celebration at Carnegie Hall, we'll trace the highs and lows of America's greatest troubadour.

Her greatness consisted of virtues that encompassed a lovely voice, warm and radiant in its range, impeccable, sophisticated rhythmic sense and flawless harmonic sensibility and intonation. What distinguished her most decisively from other singers may have been less obvious; she had great style and taste. And, a genuine shyness that only released its hold on her when she began to sing. She then soared. SYNOPSIS This two hour music documentary is a full tribute, and yes, a celebration of the greatest singer of American Popular Songs. A musical journey, it is unlike any other music special recently presented nationally. It is a program that offers the wonderful musical life and career of Ella, through several original recordings and rarely seen performances, through the ears and insights of many great celebrities, a few of whom including Dr. Billy Taylor and Anita O'Day were her peers and friends. There are the thoughts of several other musical voices including Rosemary Clooney, Al Jarreau and Shirley Horn. However, what sets this special apart from all others is the presentation of the last full, exclusive interview done with Ella Fitzgerald in 1986. Gene Davis and the ESSENCE Television Program crew spent a day at her home in Beverly Hills, talking, taping and capturing many of the personal aspects of her life and 60 year career, in Ella's own words. She is relaxed, warm and candid. Unforgettable! The complete interviews, including those of the late Dizzy Gillespie and late music critic Leonard Feather, were originally licensed for new production usage, in 1995 and a license update in 1999, by the Gene Davis Group, Inc., from ESSENCE Communications, Inc. Discussions about the program were initiated with A&E Television Networks in 1995. ...Ella talks about her own celebrity; \"Well, I think, uh, when we get so where we feel that we know what we're doing...or we think we're great...then you lose interest...at least that's the way I feel...I don't ever want to feel I think I'm the greatest. Because then you don't have anything to work...or look forward to. I like to feel that every time I can learn something more...and I can try to do better.\" ...about her greatness as a jazz/pop singer; \"It puts pressure on you. And I don't feel that I'm the greatest jazz singer. I think that great, late Billie Holiday...Miss Billie Holiday was one of the greatest jazz singers. I sing jazz and I sing pop...and I try to sing...I...in fact I try to sing a little of everything...'cause I feel like I wanna reach everybody...\" ...about her early recordings with greats like Benny Goodman; \"I made a ...uh, a few records with him...and, one of them became very popular..but the late Chick Webb was recording for another company...so they changed my name 'cause the song became a big hit; \"Good Night, My Love.\" And they changed my name to Evelyn Fields...\" ELLA AND AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC & JAZZ Ella's life encompaseed many musical levels and aspects. The program virtually chronicles the evolution of American popular music, jazz and their exponents, as seen through Ella's musical growth and life. Ella's recollections of music greats like Count Basie, all of whom she performed with, help illuminate the program's musical focus and point of view. Ella's definitive and musically inventive approach to singing can be heard in many younger performers, today. We have interviewed, exclusively for this special two younger singers Carmen Bradford and Brian McKnight. NANCY WILSON hosts the special with support from Quincy Jones and Benny Carter, who set her career in motion, in 1995. Her long time friend and manager Norman Granz is paid tribute to, as well.", "She was known as the First Lady of Song, and was the greatest scat artist to ever lay down a track of bebop. She was, of course, Ella Fitzgerald, and she is remembered and honored in this double-length <I>Biography</I> special.", "Hosted by R&B legend Nancy Wilson, this A&E Entertainment tribute highlights Fitzgerald's seven-decade career as one of the greatest and most recognizable voices in jazz. Beginning with her teenage win of the Amateur Night contest at the legendary Apollo Theatre, her alliance with some of the best bands in jazz music, two short marriages, and her passing in June 1996, the audience is treated to a definitive history of this great singer, as well as many memorable tunes that she made famous.", "Interviews with some of her best friends in the music industry, such as Dizzy Gillespie, as well as contemporary voices such as Al Jarreau and Abbey Lincoln, illustrate the influence Fitzgerald's gift had on the music industry. The video features live performances, and also focuses on her signature albums, such as the enormously successful \"Songbook\" series.", "Much of Fitzgerald's life is touched upon here, but it is a credit to this <I>Biography</I> that, even after 100&nbsp;minutes the viewer is left wanting more. <I>--Zachary Lively</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Biography - Ella Fitzgerald: Forever Ella VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "", "feature": [], "rank": "449,174 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0767027590", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft.

Lucas's later, chance meeting with Parry (Robin Williams), a homeless man suffering from dementia, gets him involved in the unlikely quest for the Holy Grail. The rickety, and patently unrealistic stand that insanity is just a wonderful place to be, and that the homeless are all errant knights, wears awfully thin, but there are numerous moments of sad grace and violent beauty in this film. The screenplay by Richard LaGravenese launched his successful career and his smart wordplay helped garner Mercedes Ruehl an Oscar as Lucas's girlfriend. <i>--Keith Simanton</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Fisher King", "also_buy": ["B0043X1FL8", "B00IBKXU2Q", "6305144168", "B00005QCTY", "B00007GZR5", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00000IQV7", "B000B8QG22", "B00P16DFEQ", "B000N4RAR4", "B0007PALZ2", "630587493X", "B0000633R5", "B003LR5BD0", "0783225903", "B000053VAZ", "B000ARFPNK", "B0011E5M66", "0792833198", "B00003CWS3", "B003IQBLSI", "B00008L3U1", "B002PI1NRO", "B0000YEEGM", "0767811100", "B07925M5XZ", "6305262128", "B001AZIRYA", "B004SIP6C2", "B00007976T", "B00OZYEM4C", "B01KP7LAQ0", "B072ZLXZ9P", "B001HN69AY", "B00NMUCHMY", "B0112HPTCI", "B0039A9MES", "B000BYA4IS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00079HZOS", "B00007AJFD", "630542845X", "B00005NKT5", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B002GOAGZC", "0792838068", "B00008K7AO", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000077VQ6", "B004SIP95G", "B07DRYCV9V", "B0011E5RXO", "B003Y5H59C", "B00AEFYCL4", "B0034GK78W", "B00X3DC8RE", "B000HC2LHG", "B0006GVJE4", "B000066HAS", "B00009W5CA", "B00AEFZ63M", "B00X99BT4U", "B00005OLYF", "078322799X", "B074J5X1JV", "0790742047", "B000VE439Y", "B00M7D82E4", "B06XGX1FKS", "B06XNRK6PW", "B000021Y7X", "B0045HCIZE", "B001HN69B8", "B0043X1FKY", "B00OYSWNB8", "B005TBQS3I", "B073MDN9NF", "B07G1YKPPM", "B01LTHZVTW", "B000R8YC18", "B00007BKVC", "B00RO49JC0", "B000TXP56C", "B0045O2PFK", "B000LP6KMQ", "B07HSM5VQP", "1558908404", "B0007QJ1XE", "630471193X", "B01MF78RLG", "B004ALIG0G", "B07894H9N6", "B07169PW2F", "B00OQVS1B4", "B004SIP7F8", "B0000DJZ8R", "B000LC5B7O", "B003UESJME", "B004SEUIXS", "B000CCBCAS"], "tech2": "", "brand": "David Pierce", "feature": [], "rank": "11,485 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00UUOVCQM", "B000B8QG22", "B0045O2PFK", "B00000IQV7", "B0043X1FL8", "B00P16DFEQ", "B00IBKXU2Q", "6305144168", "B001EKP5E6", "0792833198", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00007GZR5", "630587493X", "B00007976T", "B00NMUCHMY", "B0112HPTCI", "B000G8NXZA", "B000N4RAR4", "B000FDEVA2", "B003LR5BD0", "B0000633R5", "B003IQBLSI", "B0011E5M66", "B000ARFPNK", "B000LC5B7O", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B00005NKT5", "B002PI1NRO", "B00008L3U1", "B00005QCTY", "0783225903", "B00079HZOS", "B074R49T1H", "B000077VQ6", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JPQE", "B000BYA4IS", "B0034GK78W", "6305428352", "B07JZQCGS1", "B00O9ZSKP4", "B003ASLJK4", "B000KB4898", "B00007AJFD", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000J3FBDO", "B004ALIG0G", "B00003CWS3", "B001D7T6BS", "B0013XZ774", "1558908404", "B073VS8VCG", "6304584210", "B0039A9MES", "B00O4CWP7G", "0783229526", "B01LTHZVTW", "B003UESJME", "B002CPMB9O"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$12.98", "asin": "0767811089", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

With Uma Thurman as the woman who loves Vincent and identifies with his struggle, <I>Gattaca</I> is both stylish and smart, while Jude Law's performance lends the film a note of tragic and heartfelt humanity. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Gattaca", "also_buy": ["B0001CNRAM", "B00009ZYC0", "B06XGTFR9F", "B0069UP2PI", "B0001WTULW", "B0018O4YT0", "B008JFUN50", "B00LHCYFKQ", "B00003CXXP", "B004LWZW7E", "B00RDZMYJU", "B017S3OP7A", "B002GIBVVG", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00005JMJG", "B00XI059W8", "B0006FYOTC", "B000006FQS", "B0051MKNV8", "B000N6TX1I", "B000MZGN54", "B000Y7U98C", "B004WCTLNY", "B0007PALZ2", "B00M7D82E4", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00003CWU3", "B0007R4T3U", "B002GHHHJC", "B00QK4AN6Q", "B00UGQ3GIQ", "B01MYZJYBD", "B004L9GMBC", "B008JFUO36", "B0050MB5KM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B004EQAVHI", "B0009A40ES", "B00AEFYYP8", "B000YABYLA", "B004SIP83Y", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00E0KWBAI", "B00005JN3W", "B072QLMDPX", "B000063UR1", "B00005JMZK", "B00005ATQ9", "B0045HCJ9O", "B01LTHYE04", "B00009ATIX", "B00005JKFR", "B00005JN0T", "B004M9ZI0M", "B01LTI1RHG", "0790732203", "B002ZG980U", "B00067BCBI", "B0002V7OI8", "B001TOD92C", "B0012KSUTU", "B00H83EUQW", "B00QK4AOPG", "B000OA8OK4", "B00H3JHGBC", "B00005JMXX", "B0027BOL4G", "B0013PSTMC", "B0000714BZ", "B00004BZIY", "B001OQCV1K", "B0000YEEGM", "B015S4DRP2", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00006LPGP", "B019EUZ6O6", "B001R3YRG2", "B0098N559G", "B001AQT0RC", "B00PLYTPEM", "B002T9H2MO", "B01MF78RLG", "B0006GVJE4", "B000BW7QWW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JPAR", "B07DKY35VW", "B00005AQMJ", "B0002CHK1S", "B000BOH904", "B004529NMK", "B0001GOH6Q", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002C4JJ4", "B01LTHO65W", "B004XQO90O", "B0170Y5M4W", "B00QMP4EDQ"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Ernest Borgnine", "feature": [], "rank": "15,137 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0013PSTMC", "0800195175", "B01M8PPYGH", "B0018O4YT0", "B00009ZYC0", "B00003CXXP", "B0001CNRAM", "B074WWVJ4K", "B002GHHHKQ", "B06XGTFR9F", "B00QK4AN6Q", "B01CIXVWOY", "B002T9H2MO", "B002ZG97J2", "B0018RM336", "B01M5INUGM", "B074J6Y2B3", "B000Y7U98C", "B004LWZW7E", "B072QLMDPX", "B0007PALZ2", "0783225903", "B0069UP2PI", "B00RDZMYJU", "B00M7D82E4", "B000OVLBHG", "B000FS9FCG", "B0007N1JC8", "B00005QAQH", "B00003CWRX", "B000LC55F2", "B005LAII3A", "B00H9HZITU", "B000000WF9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000N6TX1I", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005QCVX", "B00005JMJG", "B0043X1FL8", "B000VECAD0", "B06XGQZJVQ", "B00005JPAR", "B00005JNTI", "B0006GAOBI", "B004XQO90O", "B00UC9TLWC", "B000PAAJYW", "B001TUZG4K", "B01N5FVAU3", "B00000K3TS", "B000JMK6LW", "B0011E5M66", "B00000K2SS", "B0002CHIJC", "B008JFUN50", "B004SIP7TE", "B00XI059W8", "B00008Z56W"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$21.95", "asin": "0767805712", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Busted for attempting to smuggle hashish out of Istanbul, American college student Billy Hayes (Davis) is thrown into the city's most brutal jail. After suffering through four years of sadistic torture and inhuman conditions, Billy is about to be released when his parole is denied. Only his inner courage and the support of a fellow inmate (Hurt) give him the strength to catch the MIDNIGHT EXPRESS ... and escape his living hell.", "Forever embroiled in controversy, <I>Midnight Express</I> divides viewers into opposing camps: those who think it's one of the most intense real-life dramas ever made, and those who abhor its manipulative tactics and alteration of facts for the exploitative purpose of achieving a desired effect. That effect is powerfully achieved, regardless of how you may feel about director Alan Parker and Oscar&reg;-winning screenwriter Oliver Stone's interpretation of the story of Billy Hayes. It was the American Hayes--played by the late Brad Davis in an unforgettable performance--who was caught smuggling two kilograms of hashish while attempting to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970. He was sentenced to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended (though not by 30 years, as the film suggests), and Hayes endured unthinkable brutality and torture before his escape in 1975.", "Unquestionably, this is a superbly crafted film, provoking a visceral response that's powerful enough to boil your blood. By the time Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence, Parker and Stone have proven the power--and danger--of their skill. Their film is deeply manipulative, extremely xenophobic, and embellishes reality to heighten its calculated impact. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, and there's no doubt that <I>Midnight Express</I> is expertly directed and blessed with exceptional supporting performances (especially from John Hurt as a long-term prisoner). Still, it's obvious that strings are being pulled, and Parker, while applying his talent to a nefarious purpose, is a masterful puppeteer. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Midnight Express", "also_buy": ["B006TTC5HC", "B0008ENHUI", "0792833287", "B01LTHXM1Q", "B000RTB0R6", "B000CNESTE", "B07JX4PPQC", "B003ELKNH2", "6305714886", "0988981440", "079284646X", "B073MDN9NF", "B0019UGYK0", "B000R8YC18", "B000286RP2", "B00007ELEY", "B07GJ7977V", "B000HC2LHG", "B074GTQ2B6", "B07HSK3DWC", "B003O7I6SE", "B00004XPPC", "B00407PNX8", "B00AQ7CUKA", "B0008ENHTY", "B00003CXB5", "0767827902", "B0045HCJIA", "B0785VLCFD", "B07BZBW89B", "0767817729", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXBU", "B074J5PRMJ", "B07G2CJPP9", "B06XGCTH88", "B01LTHN4RS", "B074GWVCYK", "B000F1IQN2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B000XJD34I", "B000C20VRS", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000022TSY", "B000E5N684", "B074GVVQQX", "B071FGJ3R5", "B000BZIST4", "B000Q6GUWK", "B07FLG9Z7N", "B00005LC4R", "B003INBNOS", "B07H5VTTBH", "B074J39ZD5", "B074J6Y2BR", "B001GD6VTE", "B00008MTVY", "6305213305", "B07G28Y3XV", "B0045HCJTO", "B0045HCIZE", "B0009HLD4Q", "B008FYZIZK", "B072ZLN4NY", "B004FQX5B6", "B00708YU24", "B000KGGJ0Y", "0783227906", "6305594333", "B07GJFS31Y", "0792838416", "B001R3YRG2", "B0047BXR0S", "B00004STDN", "B00VHAG4I4", "B000022TS6", "B003UGLCIA", "B079ZT1TYC", "B00008RH3L", "B074J612CJ", "B074J7QCVX", "B074JD6F6Z", "B06XGTYV5Q", "0767824555", "B00066FBQG", "B0711M6TBL", "B003ASLJKO", "B000NTMA0G", "B010GJM86S", "B00013RC2U", "B00003CXCF", "B0001US62I", "B000M5AJQS", "B000P0J0EW", "B003TRMLQM", "B07FSRB4NM", "B00003CXBH", "B00005Q4CS", "B010GJM7WS"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Paolo Bonacelli", "feature": [], "rank": "29,438 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B000RTB0R6", "B01LTHXM1Q", "B006TTC5HC", "0792833287", "B0008ENHUI", "0988981440", "B0019UGYK0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00008O38F", "B0045HCJIA", "B0006HBZXS", "079284646X", "B003O7I6SE", "0792846443", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0001US62I", "B004FQX5B6", "B0006GAOJA", "B000R8YC18", "B073MDN9NF", "0792838408", "B074J7C8WP", "B000EHSVS2", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005PJ8T", "0783226853", "B006FE83UE", "B000P0J09C", "B007XF4J66", "B0010YSD7W", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B004FQX5A2", "B003ELKNH2", "B000C20VRS", "0792833198", "B001R3YRG2", "B00DGXKOLI", "B000BZIST4", "B01JZKX020", "B06XGSKJVD", "0792846435", "B00006L91I", "B0152AVXDA", "B00LFHYWW4", "B003L8PDA0", "B01LTHN4RS", "B0043X1FL8", "B003PIUII8", "B011SDC1LI", "B0029ATTAQ", "B07CZFPYX9", "0783226039", "B0045HCIZE", "B00006ADD5", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC8O", "B00AEBB95K", "B002HWRYJE"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$7.38", "asin": "0767817486", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Chosen to test BLUE THUNDER,Frank Murphy (Scheider) is amazed by the high-speed, high-tech chopper. It can see through walls, record a whisper or level a city block. Distrusting the military mentality behind BLUE THUNDER, Murphy and his partner Lymangood (Daniel Stern) soon discover that the remarkable craft is slated for useas the ultimate weapon in surveillance and crowd control. Jeopardized after being discovered by sinister Colonel Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), Murphy flies BLUE THUNDER against military aircraft in a spellbinding contest over Los Angeles.", "\"Suspense in a void\" is how critic Pauline Kael described this action-packed hit from 1983. In other words, this is one of those flashy, superbly crafted high-tech thrillers in which the star is a machine, while intelligent plotting and human characters are a lesser priority. The machine in question is <I>Blue Thunder</I>--a heavily armored prototype helicopter that is secretly being tested for use in a devious government conspiracy. Roy Scheider plays the police pilot who catches on to the nefarious plot and takes to the skies against an evil army colonel (Malcolm McDowell) who will defend his coconspirators at any cost. Director John Badham was a hot property in the early '80s (he directed <I>WarGames</I> the same year), and <I>Blue Thunder</I> served as the popular model for many formulaic action thrillers to follow. That doesn't make it a great movie, but with a fine cast (including Daniel Stern in a memorable supporting role) and a dazzling aerial chase among big-city skyscrapers, <I>Blue Thunder</I> qualifies as slick entertainment. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Blue Thunder", "also_buy": ["B000G8NXV4", "B01CZ3K21Q", "B003ASLJMW", "B00555ZTQK", "B0015NORDW", "B01HSAIP6A", "B000063UR5", "B00008L3UF", "B0008JIJ2O", "B00GX7D5G0", "B079JGGX3P", "B07BY5TRXT", "B0077T5SV8", "B0006B2A42", "B0007KIFGE", "B07FSRB4NM", "B00004TX5G", "B074J4TLW2", "B000096IAC", "B0765B2VQR", "B07GX5PW3P", "B00441GYOM", "B0043X1FOK", "B00XPYGZDO", "B07F5CPBPQ", "B002OGMGV4", "B000QUCRB4", "B06XGCTH88", "B00USBLX8Y", "B003CNQPNS", "B0006GANOQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B007N31YH0", "0792843592", "B000055Y0Y", "B003ASLJKO", "B000MNOX94", "B000068NNU", "B074JD6F6Z", "B00008L3UQ", "B010VD8UUW", "B00008438U", "0767812166", "B07G1YKPPM", "B00368PSKK", "B01C69QV64", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0002J58HO", "B01M7SPXI4", "B000A50460", "B0007TKNGA", "B016XFUYU6", "B0009JE6G6", "B00003CWU3", "B07DXSK91B", "B000FO0AA6", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0014WAC3I", "B074GVVQQX", "B074VCVZT1", "B00U0SSDYW", "6305657947", "B07BF2PQL6", "B077SXKF7Z", "0783240295", "B00NQ4FK7A", "B0001NBMH6", "B0748TT9D3", "B01N9CP5G1", "B0000542CK", "B06XGRHLF8", "B00009NHC0", "6304779607", "B002GHHHJC", "B076DZ6HVR", "6305133468", "B002GSXKNI", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00000G3PA", "B06XGTYV5Q", "B075FLBWYJ", "0783229364", "B07DY2M93M", "B000PFUAN2", "B0045HCJIK", "1858755220", "B00KOW4AZK", "B0013527K2", "B00000ILDE", "B00368PSKU", "B00026ZG10", "B0045HCJ0S", "B007STBUHI", "B01MDMFW2Q", "B00M4KXLGY", "B00407PNX8", "B0045HCJSA"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Warren Oates", "feature": [], "rank": "24,094 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B000KLQUSU", "B000G8NXV4", "B01CZ3K21Q", "B01M744JRO", "B01GWCLR6K", "B000EBIOW6", "B079J8RPMK", "B01HSAIP6A", "B000BZIST4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001EKZV3G", "B0024FADAQ", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG98UA", "B000KRRNA8", "B0015NORDW", "B000W1SZBS", "B003ASLJMW", "B004EPYZSK", "B0019BI1DM", "B000056WR3", "B0001VTPWM", "B07KH8W763", "B0001FGBWK", "B00KC7QJC4", "B0765B2VQR", "B002HGRI96", "B000EHSVR8", "B0004Z33EG", "B00555ZTQK", "0783241895", "B001R3YRG2", "B002T9H2LA", "B00K31RBPS", "B072BQKLP5", "B07BXWY51T", "6304936532", "B001JEO5ZC", "B00JPQ1IQ0", "B002LMV7R0", "079284646X", "B079FGMFDJ", "B000P0J09C", "B002Z7FWBI", "B0000524E5", "B074J4TLW2", "B00005JM8W", "B002GHHHOM", "B011MHCCQO", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000PFUAN2", "B000065U1N", "6304602944", "B000A1INJE", "B00A2H9OSK", "B00004Y62V", "B079PDFH5S", "0783227396", "B01M9E277T", "B00004ZBVG"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$10.70", "asin": "0767817648", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

The little boy never turns up, and the family has to deal with the devastating guilt and grief that goes along with it. Nine years later, the family has relocated to Chicago. By a sheer fluke, the kid turns up, living no more than two blocks away. The authorities swoop down and return the kid to his biological parents, but things are far from being that simple. The boy grew up around what he has called his father, while his new family are strangers to him; the older son, now a teenager, has brushes with the law and behavioral problems. His adjustment to his lost brother is complicated by normal teenage churlishness, and the dad (Treat Williams) seems to expect everything to fall into place as though the family had been intact all along. It's a tightrope routine for actors in a story like this, being careful not to chew the scenery while at the same time not being too flaccid or understated. For the most part, the members of the cast deal well with the emotional complexity of their roles. Though the story stretches credulity, weirder things do happen in the real world. The family's pain for the first half of the film is certainly credible, though the second half almost seems like a different movie. Whoopi Goldberg plays the detective assigned to the case; casting her is a bit of a stretch, but she makes it work.

Joey has a comfortable relationship with Vera (Rita Hayworth, Gilda), a former dancer who is now a rich widow. But when Linda (Kim Novak, Vertigo) enters his life, Joey suddenly has to choose between convenience and something far more substantial.", "First born in the pages of <I>The New Yorker</I>, then translated into a hit Rodgers and Hart Broadway musical, the title character of <I>Pal Joey</I> had undergone quite a transformation by the time he hit the movies in 1957. He was a singer, rather than a dancer, but more importantly he'd had his rough edges sweetly softened; the callous heel dreamed up by novelist John O'Hara was more of a naughty scamp in the film version. However, <I>Pal Joey</I> remains delightfully watchable for two very good reasons: a terrific song score and a surplus of glittering star power. Frank Sinatra, at the zenith of his cocky, world-on-a-string popularity, glides through the film with breezy nonchalance, romancing showgirl Kim Novak (Columbia Pictures' new sex symbol) and wealthy widow Rita Hayworth (Columbia Pictures' former sex symbol). The film also benefits from location shooting in San Francisco, caught in the moonlight-and-supper-club glow of the late '50s. Sinatra does beautifully with the Rodgers and Hart classics \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\" and \"I Could Write a Book,\" and his performance of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" (evocatively shot by director George Sidney) is flat-out genius. Sinatra's ease with hep-cat lingo nearly outdoes Bing Crosby at his best, and included in the DVD is a trailer in which Sinatra instructs the audience in \"Joey's Jargon,\" a collection of hip slang words such as \"gasser\" and \"mouse.\" If not one of Sinatra's very best movies, <I>Pal Joey</I> is nevertheless a classy vehicle that fits like a glove. <I>--Robert Horton</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Pal Joey", "also_buy": ["B00EL6ABL2", "B0015FGCI8", "B00005LOL7", "B00143XE1E", "B00143XE2I", "B00178T3Q6", "B0013LL2X4", "B0071U3MRA", "B00009ZPU1", "B0013LL2XO", "B00143XDYC", "B00AATV0WS", "B000ND91YU", "B00143XE28", "B00178T122", "B00143XE0K", "0767827791", "B00004XPPK", "B006X0ZMX6", "B00143XE00", "0767821556", "B000EOTUS0", "B0045HCJQM", "B01MY7SB4V", "B00GOC752E", "B0017CW5H6", "B0001LJCRA", "B003NF97IU", "B00143XE1O", "B00007J5VN", "B00IO8YQ28", "B00004RF9K", "B00020X88Y", "B0013LL2XE", "B00005O3VD", "B0045HCJJY", "B00004VVMZ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B072MLKLW6", "B001MBTSTA", "B0045HCIZO", "B00PMM6NSO", "B00006IUJS", "B0007939MK", "B008RO6PIM", "B000EEQI3K", "B0007939NO", "B06Y276QCQ", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000J10HYE", "B00000JRW5", "B00005ALMH", "B000F7CMQ8", "B000FFJYAC", "B0725PFM7X", "B00143XE1Y", "B000F7CMQI", "B000PAAK5A", "B0007PALZW", "B00MQLQE10", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000068QJP", "B074GTWP8C", "B00MYMTAJO", "B00005JNA9", "B000EXDS7A", "B00004W229", "B077Y9BPRD", "B073ZT7SVF", "B002GSXKQA", "B00K6D1RO4", "B00406UJZG", "B00GOYHSKQ", "B00008MTW2", "B000O76ZR6", "B00008CMRN", "B00004TWZH", "B000EBD9S0", "B000WTVZHQ", "B071G6M87N", "B071G7H8CF", "B000EBD9SK", "B06XZ4H449", "B014IAWFKU", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000006OHD", "0767827651", "B000N3T0GY", "B00ST5TC02", "B0000VJG1S", "B000W089Y2", "630521056X", "B000H1RFPA", "B00070HK2Y", "B00BATGC16", "0790742063", "B012YPUZ26", "B0007Z0O9U"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Bobby Sherwood", "feature": [], "rank": "34,994 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0015FGCI8", "B00EL6ABL2", "B00009ZPU1", "B0013LL2XO", "B0071U3MRA", "B00SIHM7PI", "B00AATV0WS", "B00143XE1E", "B003O2H7MA", "0767827791", "0767827651", "B0001LJCRA", "0767821556", "B00005LOL7", "B01MY7SB4V", "B01IWFPI56", "B00143XDYC", "B00004XPPK", "B0013LL2X4", "B01N6TVQPR", "B015UE84E4", "B01N7E2DPW", "B0007Z0O9U", "B077Y9BPRD", "B00008AOWL", "B01HOJ9K4G", "B00178T3Q6", "B00DDHFKUM", "B01J7M44MG", "B01N1O5UBB", "B00004W229", "B000JLQPQI", "B0017CW5H6", "B00X3PJ1KY", "B00PMM6NSO", "B0024FAG7Q", "B005NFJAZS", "B000025HYW", "B00143XE00", "B000ND91YU", "B008RO6PIM", "B000HT3PGU", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00K6D1RO4", "B00143XE2I", "B00D3LA6RK", "B00143XE28", "B07GGG4143", "B0007939MK", "B06Y276QCQ", "B00143XDZQ", "B005GP7ELW", "B012YPUZ26", "B000WC39ZY", "B00004TWZH", "B0000VJG1S", "B00P6IFGAU", "B00005N90X", "B00006ADD5"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$22.99", "asin": "0767821807", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

By any rational measure of comedy, this medieval romp from the Monty Python troupe certainly belongs on the short list of candidates. According to <i>Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide</i>, it's \"recommended for fans only,\" but we say hogwash to that--you could be a complete newcomer to the Python phenomenon and still find this send-up of the Arthurian legend to be wet-your-pants hilarious. It's basically a series of sketches woven together as King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail, with Graham Chapman as the King, Terry Gilliam as his simpleton sidekick Patsy, and the rest of the Python gang filling out a variety of outrageous roles. The comedy highlights are too numerous to mention, but once you've seen Arthur's outrageously bloody encounter with the ominous Black Knight (John Cleese), you'll know that nothing's sacred in the Python school of comedy. From holy hand grenades to killer bunnies to the absurdity of the three-headed knights who say \"Ni--!,\" this is the kind of movie that will strike you as fantastically funny or just plain silly, but why stop there? It's all over the map, and the pace lags a bit here and there, but for every throwaway gag the Pythons have invented, there's a bit of subtle business or grand-scale insanity that's utterly inspired. The sum of this madness is a movie that's beloved by anyone with a pulse and an irreverent sense of humor. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, you're almost certainly dead. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "also_buy": ["0767827724", "B00U0WY2V6", "B000G6BLWE", "0790757354", "B000G6BLW4", "B00USBLX4I", "B00287Z18Y", "B000E6ESIK", "B000TJBNHG", "B06XGTH7R4", "B006TTC5GS", "B00004RJ73", "B00005JNBQ", "B06XGD93BP", "B000063K2R", "B0088XQEDS", "B002FE5XU6", "B003DF44SI", "B00JMVRBNW", "B07C3QZ5WM", "B00008G8M4", "B000G6BLQU", "0792841409", "B00W9DYK2K", "B00028HBES", "B06XGQZJVQ", "B00005PJ6O", "B01MD0Z6OV", "B0000CBY1C", "B00A24CAAW", "0790740044", "B00003CXRM", "B00005ALS0", "B004AOECXI", "B00HFWETIK", "B00BY0EBK0", "B074PB2LFV", "1419855123", "B002XUBDRY", "B00NT71BNQ", "B007LNBS2I", "B002GSXKN8", "B00M0JU1XU", "B01JCV3NF6", "B001E75QH0", "B079VDDFCX", "B002CLBJPK", "B0006419KA", "B000VBIGD6", "1984822586", "B075FSRZK8", "B073RVFNV2", "B000VBIGCW", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B01HSIIFQ2", "B073ZWJWTP", "B000TJBN6W", "B07G2MYV7Z", "B00MMPB6R2", "1368024041", "B07BYWVLZR", "0393635244", "B07CXZ9C5B"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Graham Chapman", "feature": [], "rank": "75,952 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B01MD0Z6OV", "B000B8IA3K", "B00008WQ9X", "B000CCKAVA", "B001E12ZAM", "B0142A6O4E", "B00UGPDZV0", "B00NPXB8ZK", "0767827724", "B000HWXQPC", "B004X4SG3M", "B000E6ESIK", "B01GWDZLN4", "B00U0WY2V6", "B0009XRZ92", "B003DF44SI", "B00Q3F0GG4", "B000G6BLWE", "B000G6BLW4", "B000GEIRSM", "B00UGQ9U04", "0790757354", "B002FE5XU6", "B01EMBI45K", "B00AEFXDO6", "B07HGMG6Y6", "0767853520", "B00NGAJCVO", "B00USBLX4I", "B06XGD93BP", "B01HUU1ND0", "B00000JSJE", "B0088XQEDS", "B00FAVVS7S", "B006GQVI4O", "B0011E5M66", "B00UGQ1RA0", "B074QS28GX", "B00JE79IZS", "B000MQCSCK", "B00K7CTDT0", "B07C3QZ5WM", "B074R49T1H", "B000TJBNHG", "B0007OY2TE", "1423400046", "B0006FUEDC", "B00W9DYK2K", "B00006880X", "B004XDOLAU", "B00287Z18Y", "B000BMY2LU"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$19.47", "asin": "0767824571", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Co-starring Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle and Cybill Shepherd, the film is presented on Blu-ray for the first time following an extensive 4K digital restoration and remastering under the guidance of cinematographer Michael Chapman and director Martin Scorsese.", "<i>Taxi Driver</i> is the definitive cinematic portrait of loneliness and alienation manifested as violence. It is as if director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader had tapped into precisely the same source of psychological inspiration (&quot;I just knew I had to make this film,&quot; Scorsese would later say), combined with a perfectly timed post-Watergate expression of personal, political, and societal anxiety. Robert De Niro, as the tortured, ex-Marine cab driver Travis Bickle, made movie history with his chilling performance as one of the most memorably intense and vividly realized characters ever committed to film. Bickle is a self-appointed vigilante who views his urban beat as an intolerable cesspool of blighted humanity. He plays guardian angel for a young prostitute (Jodie Foster), but not without violently devastating consequences. This masterpiece, which is not for all tastes, is sure to horrify some viewers, but few could deny the film's lasting power and importance. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Taxi Driver", "also_buy": ["B0006GAOJA", "B006TTC5HC", "B000286RP2", "B003ELKNH2", "B073MDN9NF", "B000CNESTE", "0792833287", "B010GJM7WS", "B000022TSY", "B01LZHNDQC", "B000P0J09M", "B004FQX5B6", "B000C20VRS", "B000HC2LEY", "B000C20VPA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B074P3TPZV", "B000BZIST4", "B004SIP95G", "B010GJM836", "0767802519", "B008D1Q1VA", "079284646X", "B004SIP7TE", "B000A2UBN4", "B00079Z9VO", "B003TRMLQM", "B00003CXBU", "B000PAAJZ6", "B074J5PRMJ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000UJ48T0", "B00005Q4CS", "B00006RCNV", "B01M24PD63", "B0068FZ0M4", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00005V9HH", "B011MUA6NW", "B004BKYE48", "B000M5AJQS", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJIA", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000286RR0", "B00062IVL2", "B006TTC5MM", "B008R65XYC", "B0009A40ES", "B007PSIYP8", "B0047BXR0S", "B00LU4URLW", "B01M5JFHWP", "B000063US3", "6304907729", "B0000YEEGM", "B0019UGYK0", "B004U7MR14", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B001JIE7JC", "B004O8LETK", "B010GJM86S", "B0000AM6JI", "B000A7DVR2", "B07C5K7R9Q", "B07895XFQY", "B003B354YK", "B00441GYPG", "0792841409", "B00871C09S", "B00006ADD5", "B07288ZH3P", "B01F0XMVQW", "B000055Y0X", "B000063US2", "B074GWVCYK", "B00KLMFUKW", "B004SIP8ZM", "B06XGTYV5Q", "B00004XPPC", "B00003CXD5", "B003ZYU3TG", "B074J7C8WP", "B000LP6KNU", "B0045HCJTO", "B000063JDE", "B0045HCJ94", "B00UUOVIR0", "B00G4Q3KOC", "0783226845", "B079VF7PZM", "B003INBNOS", "B001WLMOL4", "B016XFUYU6", "B0001US62I", "B072ZM1FQZ", "B00020X88Y", "B000E5N684", "B0007DFJ0G"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Cybill Shepherd", "feature": [], "rank": "83,930 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B073MDN9NF", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GAOJA", "B01GWCQA62", "B000286RP2", "B000286RR0", "B000RETOHY", "B00006RCNV", "B014AGF6RG", "B003ELKNH2", "B000C20VPA", "B009GXTG0C", "B001KN8WJ2", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP95G", "B00009W5CA", "B01LZHNDQC", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP7TE", "B010GJM7WS", "B00008975Z", "B072ZM1FQZ", "B000UJ48T0", "B004BKYE48", "B000BZIST4", "B000M341QE", "B0064NTZQ2", "B010GJM836", "B01GWCR264", "B004MW57KA", "B01GWCG6EI", "B000WC39ZY", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767802519", "B0087ZG7UW", "B004U7MR14", "B000067J1H", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000AM6JI", "B01MAWQRUU", "B011MUA6NW", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B000P0J09C", "B003AWRMCE", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B003XURDAY", "B002T9H2LA", "B00GMT69C6", "B010GJM86S", "B00UGQEYIM", "B00005V9HH", "B01D3LBCAE", "B006TTC5MM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B07895XFQY", "0792833287", "B01M24PD63", "B008220DIC", "B00001ZWUS", "B000UJ48VI"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$20.19", "asin": "0767830555", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman star in two-time Oscar(r) nominee Wolfgang Petersen's gripping thriller about an uncompromising U.S. President who has just told the world he will not negotiate with terrorists. When Russian neo-nationalists hijack Air Force One, the world's most secure and extraordinary aircraft, the President is faced with a nearly impossible decision to give in to terrorist demands or sacrifice not only the country's dignity,but the lives of his wife and daughter.", "You know that old dramatic principle of suspension of disbelief? You'll have to rely on it for this box-office smash, but you won't be disappointed. Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects. Director Wolfgang Petersen (<i>Das Boot</i>) keeps the action moving so fast you won't be sweating the details.

{"category": ["Movies & TV", "Studio Specials", "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "All Sony Pictures Titles"], "tech1": "", "description": ["SLEEPLESS/GODZILLA/MASK OF Z/GHOSTBUS - DVD Movie", "<B><I>Sleepless in Seattle</I></B><br> The director and stars of 1998's <I>You've Got Mail</I> scored a breakthrough hit with this hugely popular romantic comedy from 1993, about a recently engaged woman (Meg Ryan) who hears the sad story of a grieving widower (Tom Hanks) on the radio and believes that they're destined to be together. She's single in New York, he lives in Seattle with a young son, but the cross-country attraction proves irresistible, and pretty soon Meg's on a westbound flight. What happens from there is ... well, you must have been living in a cave to have let this sweet-hearted comedy slip below your pop-cultural radar. There's little complexity or depth to writer-director Nora Ephron's cheesy tale of a romantic fait accompli, and more than a little contrivance to the subplots that threaten to keep Hanks and Ryan from actually meeting. But the purity of star chemistry here is hard to deny, and this may be the first film to indicate the more serious and sympathetic side of Hanks that is revealed in later roles. With its clever jokes about \"chick movies\" and repeated homage to the classic weeper <I>An Affair to Remember</I>, this may not be everybody's brand of amorous entertainment, but it's got an old-Hollywood charm that appeals to many a movie fan. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>", "", "<B><I>Godzilla</I></B><br>As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit that <I>Godzilla</I> delivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact that <I>Independence Day</I> creators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of the <I>Jurassic Park</I> movies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>", "<B><I>The Mask of Zorro</I></B><br>A lusty and rousing adventure, this calls to mind those glorious costume dramas produced so capably by the old Hollywood studio system--hardly surprising, in that its title character, a de facto Robin Hood in Old California, provided starring vehicles for Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power, the '50s TV hit, and dozens of serials and features. Zorro, a pop-fiction creation invented by Johnston McCulley in 1918, is given new blood in this fast-moving and engaging version, which actually works as a sequel to the story line in the Fairbanks-Power saga, <I>The Mark of Zorro</I>. A self-assured Anthony Hopkins is Don Diego de la Vega, a Mexican freedom fighter captured and imprisoned just as Spain concedes California to Santa Ana. Twenty years later, he escapes from prison to face down his mortal enemy, a land grabbing governor played with slimy spitefulness by Stuart Wilson. Too old to save the local peasants on his own, he trains bandito Antonio Banderas to take his place. Much swashbuckling ensues as Banderas woos Catherine Zeta-Jones, becomes a better human being, and saves the disenfranchised rabble. Director Martin Campbell wisely instills a measure of frivolity into the deftly choreographed action sequences, while letting a serious tone creep in when appropriate. This covers much ground under the banner of romantic-action-adventure, and it does so most excellently. <I>--Rochelle O'Gorman</I>", "<B><I>Ghostbusters</I></B><br>Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the script, but Bill Murray gets all the best lines and moments in this 1984 comedy directed by Ivan Reitman (<I>Meatballs</I>). The three comics, plus Ernie Hudson, play the New York City-based team that provides supernatural pest control, and Sigourney Weaver is the love interest possessed by an ancient demon. Reitman and company are full of original ideas about hobgoblins--who knew they could \"slime\" people with green plasma goo?--but hovering above the plot is Murray's patented ironic view of all the action. Still a lot of fun, and an obvious model for sci-fi comedies such as <I>Men in Black</I>. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Starter Pack Sleepless in Seattle / Godzilla / The Mask of Zorro / Ghostbusters", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Bill Murray", "feature": [], "rank": "545,991 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0000AOV4I"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$49.99", "asin": "0767849833", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Hong Kong police crack an underground ring of smugglers, seizing a massive shipment of explosives. But when the arms are recovered by Japan's public enemy number one, Akatura, the countdown begins to a sale of the deadly contraband that will place the world in the hands of international mercenaries! But when a rebellious trio of GEN-X COPS infiltrate the underworld, they discover that Akatura has a much more sinister plan for the volatile cargo than fueling worldwide warfare. Now the criminal instincts that nearly barred them from the force are the most powerful weapons the GEN-X COPS have to save the city from the devastating act of terrorism!", "This is what <I>The Mod Squad</I> wanted to be. Chan (Eric Tsang), a cop on the fringe of the force, assembles a team of loose-cannon cadets--the <I>Gen-X Cops</I>--to infiltrate the mobs of Hong Kong, and they find a stolen shipment of explosive rocket fuel. Dressed in skin-tight leather and vinyl, hip to the point of being ridiculous, our heroes (named Jack, Alien, and Match) have to fight not only ultraviolent criminals but also hostile factions within the police as they track down a supercool Japanese gangster with no fear of death. The clich&eacute;s fly fast and thick, and the plot is at times incomprehensible, but the action is pretty much nonstop. A shootout in a surfboard factory is particularly spectacular but is only one of several rapidly edited, stunt-filled sequences. The dubbing is better than usual (though subtitles would still be preferable), and there's some unfortunate homophobia, but the actors are all good-looking, the rock soundtrack is loud, the colors are bright, and the attitude is intense. <i>Gen-X Cops</i> even features a cameo by Jackie Chan, who's somehow involved with presenting the film.

The video direction is by an expert in the field, Brian Large, who brings home all the intimate moments of Puccini's drama from an open set that ascends and sprawls across rows of seating. His camera draws the viewer into scenes that the audience cannot witness from a distance--most movingly when Sharpless, the American consul in Nagasaki, gives up his attempt to read Pinkerton's letter to Butterfly saying he has no intention of seeing her again (set to that magical melody which will recur as the humming chorus).", "It's of little matter that there are no operatic stars in the cast, for this ensemble consists of experienced singers who fill the night air with lungs to match Puccini's heaviest demands. The audience greets the show-stopping moments with waves of applause. Their enthusiasm may drown a few bars of orchestral continuity, but the orchestra itself is always at the service of the singers on a soundtrack that captures the atmosphere of an open-air performance with astonishing verisimilitude. Butterfly, sung by the statuesque Raina Kabaivanska, may not look 16 and some of her arm movements are overdone, but her big number, \"Un bel di,\" and its reprise are touchingly conveyed. Nor does she overplay the final scene--a moment that sends a shiver down the spine in its economy.

This sweeping saga of the legendary seventeenth-century samurai Musashi Miyamoto (powerfully portrayed by Toshiro Mifune) plays out against the turmoil of a devastating civil war. The Trilogy follows Musashi's odyssey from unruly youth to enlightened warrior. In the first part, Musashi Miyamoto, the hero's dreams of military glory end in betrayal, defeat, and a fugitive lifestyle. But he is saved by a woman who loves him and a cunning priest who guides him to the samurai path. This installment won the 1955 Academy Award&#174; for Best Foreign Film.", "Toshir&ocirc; Mifune defines the quintessential samurai in Hiroshi Inagaki's 1954 <i>Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto</i>, the first feature in a trilogy based on the epic novel by Eiji Yoshikawa. As in Kurosawa's classic <a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/0780020685/${0}\"><I>Seven Samurai</I></a>, which appeared the same year, Mifune plays a brash and ambitious peasant who desires fame and power as a swordsman. His dreams of glory in war sour when his army is routed and he becomes hunted by the authorities, but the \"tough love\" attentions of a kindly but severe monk help him develop from a hot-tempered outlaw to a thoughtful swordsman. Inagaki's somber color epic is very different from the energetic action of Kurosawa's films.

Making his last screen appearance before his tragic death, Howard plays visionary aircraft designer R.J. Mitchell, whose Spitfire was one of the Allies' greatest assets. Suspense builds in this simple but powerful story as Mitchell races to create the fastest fighter plane, then struggles to have his designs accepted by the government. The final riveting scene, which features footage of actual air combat between the British and the Nazis, pays tribute to his ultimate achievement. Two terrific actors fuel this heartfelt film: Howard as the quietly heroic Mitchell and Academy Award&#174;-winner David Niven (<I>Separate Tables</I>) as his faithful friend and test pilot. The majestic score includes William Walton's famous \"Spitfire Fugue. Spitfire", "Also known by its British title <I>The First of the Few</I>, this 1942 film is an engaging, touching account of R.J. Mitchell's dedicated efforts to design and build the Spitfire, the RAF fighter plane whose superior performance eventually won the air war against Germany in World War II. Actor Leslie Howard produced, directed, and starred in this inspiring drama at a time when England had come to embrace him as a patriotic figurehead. His humbling performance as Mitchell--who sacrificed his health in pursuit of the goal--can't help but merge in one's imagination with Howard's real-life death under Nazi fire while on a still-mysterious RAF mission. Consistent with the theme of heroic selflessness is Howard's extraordinary generosity to costar David Niven, whose own rakish performance as Mitchell's brave, dedicated test pilot is a real star turn. For a movie that is essentially about an inventor working himself ragged night and day while the love of his life helplessly looks on, <I>Spitfire</I> is anything but static, redundant, or soapy.

In the first scene, an artist confronts his creations when they take on a life of their own. In the second, he dives through a mirror (a primitive but startling effect Cocteau refines for <I>Orpheus</I>) and into a skewed hall where every door reveals a fantastic dream scene. The third sequence finds a gang of boys turning a snowball fight into a cruel war, and in the last an audience gathers to witness a dead boy's resurrection amidst a strange card game. These descriptions do little to communicate the poetry of each segment, which rely on creative imagery to create meaning not in stories but in symbols and metaphors. Cocteau's realization is often stiff and stilted, the work of a visual artist transforming still images into an medium that moves through time, but it's never less than beautiful and evocative. Cocteau returned to many of the same themes in <I>Orpheus</I> and <I>The Testament of Orpheus</I>. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>", "<b><I>Orpheus</I></b><br> A Parisian poet becomes seduced by the prospect of eternal fame in Jean Cocteau's jazzy 1949 update of the ancient Greek myth of <I>Orpheus</I>. The caf&eacute; set won't give successful Orpheus (Jean Marais) the time of day, so he obliges when the Princess of Death (Maria Casar&eacute;s) orders him into her Rolls Royce with her injured young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It isn't long before the poet realizes the commanding Princess is no ordinary benefactor of the arts; for one thing, she can travel through mirrors. The next day, Orpheus returns to his frantic wife Eurydice (Marie D&eacute;a) with the kindly chauffeur Heurtibise (Fran&ccedil;ois P&eacute;rier), but remains distracted by the Princess and the cryptic messages from her car radio. The equally smitten Princess eventually takes Eurydice before her time, which results in an underworld trial about her actions. To get his wife back, Orpheus must promise to never to look at his wife, but his heart's not in it. This black-and-white film slyly explores the dark side of the creative urge with panache. Dreamy and mesmerizing, it depicts an underworld not too different from everyday life. With subtitles. <I>--Diane Garrett</I>", "<b><I>The Testament of Orpheus</I></b><br> It is the unique power of the cinema to allow a great many people to dream the same dream together and to present illusion to us as if it were strict reality. It is, in short, an admirable vehicle for poetry.\" Jean Cocteau, at age 70, thus ruminates on the life and purpose of the creative artist in a poetic essay. Cocteau himself stars as a time-traveling poet bopping helplessly through the ages until an experimental scientist grounds him in a kind of never-never land where he defends himself to the judges of Orpheus, dies, and is resurrected to complete his sentence: \"condemned to live.\" Though the film opens with scenes from <I>Orpheus</I>, the series of symbolic encounters and surreal images more resembles <I>The Blood of a Poet</I>. What's different is his cinematic assurance and sly sense of humor: shot through with jokey gags and playful imagery, the film is less philosophical treatise than career summation by way of farewell party. He's invited fictional characters (most of the cast of <I>Orpheus</I>) and real-life friends (cameos range from Brigitte Bardot to Yul Brynner to Pablo Picasso) from his past and present to send him off to an uncertain future. The new Home Vision video and Criterion DVD releases feature the restored color sequence. Cocteau died in 1963, three years after completing the film. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Orphic Trilogy", "also_buy": ["B000PKG6O4", "B0009S4IJM", "B003ELKNO0", "B00007L4I6", "B00070HK3S", "1419897543", "B000KJTC7I", "B000067NQM", "B0009298N4", "B00005A8TW", "B00005M2C7", "B0000A02TX", "0780020707", "B001LMU19Q", "B00386OWUC", "B000SFJ4KE", "B00006JMQH"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Jean Cocteau", "feature": [], "rank": "124,776 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B005152C82", "B00007L4I6", "B0017HEYDY", "B0017HEY66", "B001DCCAVQ", "B07KL95QB4", "B0000A02TX", "B000067IY7", "B000N4SHNK", "B000G8NXYG", "B00LUSUVB4", "B000VE439Y", "0792841409", "B000E1YVZK", "B0788XWJRC", "B005152C9G", "B004I6U3PE", "B000PKG6OY", "B00GG4F0E0", "B003ELKNO0", "B00000IPHT", "B000K0YM0Y", "0780020707", "B003ICZW7I", "B07DRYF9Q7", "B000PKG6O4", "B00006673O", "B00005M2C7", "B000A7DVR2", "B07GGG4143", "B00NCJPWP4", "B003N2CVOU", "B00LUSUWMM", "B07FMPQSP4", "B07BF25T17"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$269.99", "asin": "0780023161", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

History, religion, human nature, the English, and Englishness are all carefully examined as Bennett wanders through Westminster Abbey.

The series differs from other similar documentaries in that the building is shown \"at work,\" filled with the bustling activity of the custodial staff, delivery people, preservation crews, religious figures, schoolchildren, and especially tourists. Bennett watches the early morning rituals of the \"Abbey family,\" the people who tune the organ, dust the statues, deliver the milk, attend the first service of the day, and such, and provides a general introduction to the layout and history of one of England's most popular tourist attractions. He visits the final resting places of many monarchs as well as Sir Laurence Olivier, Lord Byron, the Bront&euml; sisters, and Jane Austen. Bennett stays to experience the Abbey's quiet evening rituals--the boys' choir practice, a private tour given by the dean, and compline, the last service of the day. Bennett's narrative is at times painfully slow, wry, and effete, but it includes a wealth of amusing and informative anecdotes, citations, and historical fact.

He was an authentic American genius, a man who believed he was destined to redesign the world, creating everything anew. Over the course of his long career, Wright designed over eight hundred buildings, including such revolutionary structures as the Guggenheim Museum, the Johnson Wax Building, Fallingwater, Unity Temple and Taliesin. Wright's buildings and his ideas changed the way we live, work and see the world around us. Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural achievements were often overshadowed by the turbulence of his melodramatic life. In ninety-two years, he fathered seven children, married three time, and was almost constantly embroiled in scandal. Some hated him, some loved him, but in the end, few could deny that he was the most important architect in America - and perhaps the world. With exquisite live cinematography, fascinating interviews, and rare archival footage, this riveting film brings Wright's unforgettable story to life.", "The beauty of <I>Frank Lloyd Wright</I> is that aside from telling a long and often melodramatic story lucidly, it deals with issues of art and architecture in ways that are approachable but not simplistic. (It's also surprisingly scandalous, although this is seen as part of his art.) Wright was first and foremost a rebel who took his cues from nature, though, as one commentator points out, this is not to say his approach was natural. What he was rebelling against was the clutter and claustrophobia of Victorian architecture. The rooms he designed opened up on each other, and his exteriors seemed to grow laterally out of the landscape. All of these ideas are neatly illustrated--although it perhaps could have been explained how Wright's later, whimsical designs related to his earlier, earthbound ones--with some marvelous footage of a Wright lily pad column supporting a load of sandbags and quiet Steadicam shots of Wright interiors that give the viewer a feeling for his sense of light and harmony. The filmmakers have wisely kept the technical talk to a minimum, but they are also not afraid to step back and let the experts ruminate on the nature of his genius, even when these experts are at a loss for words. Burns has made stars of some of his commentators in previous films, and in this one the late critic Brendan Gill shines. Wright himself comes across as a man who never doubted himself, a lousy father, and self-consciously Byronic. His vitality and larger-than-life persona seemed to belong to the 19th century, making him--and this is perhaps a mixed blessing--the last of his kind. <I>--John Clark</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Frank Lloyd Wright - A film by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Edward Herrmann", "feature": [], "rank": "180,947 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00005MEPO"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$5.93", "asin": "078062176X", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Under the direction of Gregory Hoblit (who fared better with <I>Primal Fear</I>), Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, who witnesses the gas-chamber execution of a serial killer (Elias Koteas). But when another series of murders begins, Hobbes suspects that the killer's evil spirit has survived and is possessing the bodies of others to do its evil bidding. Even Hobbes's trusted partner (John Goodman) thinks the detective is losing his grip on reality, but the dire warnings of a noted linguist (Embeth Davidtz) confirm Hobbes's far-out theory, and his case intensifies toward a fateful showdown. Although its idea is better than its execution, and the story's film noir ambitions are never fully accomplished, this slickly directed thriller has some genuinely effective moments in which evil forces are entwined into the fabric of everyday reality. Among the highlights is a memorable scene in which Detective Hobbes must track the killer as the evil spirit is transferred between many people via physical contact. Even if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts, it's an intriguing hybrid that resides in the same cinematic neighborhood as <I>Seven</I> and <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> with a cast that also includes Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Fallen Snap Case", "also_buy": ["0783240295", "6304884400", "B074PTWKJC", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B074J67TC1", "078324228X", "B0000542CJ", "B002AS465K", "B00006AUJR", "6304765258", "B000GFLKF8", "B002LMV7R0", "6305718954", "B00NX73VL2", "B0000VJG72", "B002ZG997C", "B07FSRB4NM", "B00005JA9F", "B00MQLQL72", "B002CPMB9O", "B06XGSQXPZ", "B00011CZRE", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JNY3", "6305767866", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00BEIYN9Q", "0800141806", "B002ZG99TA", "B0002DB54A", "B06XGCTH87", "B00125WAXC", "B01M8IGNXD", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0009MDPYM", "B00005JLRZ", "B010GJM8EA", "B010GJM886", "B000N6UERK", "B002AT8KAG", "B06XGRHLF8", "B01LTHMF3C", "0783226888", "B000R4SMCW", "B077H8V6R9", "B002GIBVVG", "B07G1YKPPM", "B00001U0DU", "B074J612CJ", "B000069HZP", "B06XWXJWXH", "B07GRMD987", "6305428115", "B002NZK5UU", "B00871C0DO", "B07K1L6GZC", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JL3T", "B00JPQ1IK6", "B00AEBBA4K", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B010GJM836", "B000LP6KNU", "B00DDT0J92", "B072ZNBSFB", "B079ZV7BVB", "B00UGQAB4S", "630514415X", "B00004TS0G", "B00096S49Y", "B00003CWU3", "B00441GYPG", "630542845X", "B077HP64BH", "B003TRMLQM", "630471193X", "B00Y0QOGLY", "B06WWK4PT2", "0780618548", "B001R3YRG2", "B07DQMJBHS", "B000A2UBN4", "0792846443", "B01M7SPYHH", "B07CF6WRVT", "B000NTMA0Q", "B000NQRR1Q", "B005LAIILM", "B07472MCGF", "6305133409", "B002NZK5VO", "B01MT18X7N", "B00009WVSL", "B074J6Y2BJ", "B072ZLN4NY", "B00015YVDG"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Denzel Washington", "feature": [], "rank": "21,625 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0050MB4OO", "0783240295", "B00MQLQL72", "6304884400", "B00005JPD0", "B0000VJG72", "B074PTWKJC", "B002ZG997C", "B002ZG99TA", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B002AS465K", "B01M8IGNXD", "B002VWNIEA", "B07472MCGF", "B000GFLKF8", "B005LAIGRS", "6304765258", "B000OT6V0K", "B00EE41SAE", "B077H8V6R9", "B00005JKWX", "B00NX73VL2", "B01LTI0KQK", "B074J67TC1", "B008V8NRVW", "B002CPMB9O", "0800141806", "B00005JA9F", "B06XGSQXPZ", "B0045HCJGC", "B000069HZP", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CJ", "B002NZK5UU", "B0006J28L4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B01M0DFTD3", "0800177967", "B01M7SPYHH", "B002LMV7R0", "B01LTHMF3C", "B07FSRB4NM", "B06XGCTH87", "B00005JLRZ", "B00011CZRE", "B002AS464Q", "B072ZNBSFB", "078324228X", "B01F0XMVQW", "B01GFZJ1Z8", "B00005JNY3", "B00004W4UD", "B004FQX59I", "B002GIBVVG", "B001LMAK88", "B0045HCJT4", "B00Q3F0MZ4", "B002O3Z4YS", "B0038MUZ3E"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$16.88", "asin": "0780622537", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

It's a masterful coup de grace for director Alfred Hitchcock, who has built a puzzle around the corrosive power of suspicion, threaded with deft ambiguities that toy with dramatic conventions and character archetypes in nearly every frame.", "As embodied by Joan Fontaine, who nabbed an Oscar in this second outing with the director, Lina McLaidlaw is a buttoned-up, bookish heiress whose prim exterior conceals longings for a more engaged emotional life. Her solution materializes in the darkly handsome Johnnie Aysgarth, a gambler, womanizer, and spendthrift who flirts, then pursues, and soon marries her. As Aysgarth, Cary Grant is both irresistible and sinister, capable of deceit and petty theft, as well as grander designs on his bride's impending fortune. Lina's passion for Johnnie is clouded by each new revelation about his apparent dishonesty, from clandestine gambling to real estate development schemes; more troubling are clues implicating him in the death of his best friend, and the prospect that Johnnie may be slowly poisoning Lina herself. By the time we see him ascending a darkened staircase with a suspicious glass of milk, an image made all the more indelible through the spectral glow the director captures in the glass, the evidence seems damning indeed.", "In fact, even as Hitchcock stacks the deck against Johnnie, and takes full advantage of Grant's skill at conveying such menace, the director also dots his landscape with visual clues to Lina's own neurotic (and erotic) obsessions. The final scene forces us to reevaluate her behavior while leaving enough of a cloud over Johnnie to rob him, and us, of a complete exoneration. It's a wicked, unsettling payoff to a brilliantly executed thriller. <I>--Sam Sutherland</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Suspicion VHS", "also_buy": ["6301798503"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Cary Grant", "feature": [], "rank": "331,422 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$13.99", "asin": "0780626702", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

It probably won't replace <I>Rear Window</I> or <I>Psycho</I> in your affections, but the film is more than a curious footnote to the director's career. The two leads play David and Ann Smith, a devoted but endlessly squabbling couple who discover their three-year marriage isn't legal. When he unexpectedly hesitates to arrange a second wedding, she storms out in a huff and soon begins dating his solid, dependable business partner Jeff (Gene Raymond). The rest follows the formula laid down by such previous screwball comedies as <I>The Awful Truth</I> (1937) and <I>Bringing Up Baby</I> (1938): David employs fair means or foul to win back Ann's heart, causes all sorts of complicated mischief, then... well, three guesses what happens in the end.", "", "The intriguing thing about the movie is how Hitchcock takes Norman Krasna's paper-thin script and adds sly undercurrents of menace. Violence seems about to erupt in the recurring scenes where Ann shaves her husband (suggestively holding a razor up to his throat)--and there's a touch of <I>Vertigo</I> in one scary moment when a jammed amusement park ride leaves two characters dangling helplessly high above the ground.

Directed by music video veteran Russell Mulcahy (which explains the dizzying camera work), the original theatrical release made hash of an intriguing story about an &quot;Immortal&quot; from 16th-century Scotland (Christopher Lambert) who time-leaps to modern-day America with his archenemy (Clancy Brown) in hot pursuit.

Packed with witty interviews with band members, record execs, and Seattle music aficionados, much of the film places a welcome spotlight on the bands that didn't become part of the national \"grunge\" phenomenon and scores of live clips and rare recordings show that \"the Seattle Sound\" didn't begin with Nirvana or end with Soundgarden. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this ebullient rockumentary, and if you're not careful, director Doug Pray's infectious love of the music may even make you one. This video features performances by Blood Circus, Coffin Break, Crackerbash, Dead Moon, Fastbacks, Flop, Gas Huffer, The Gits, Hammerbox, Love Battery, The Melvins, The Mono Men, Mudhoney, Nirvana, The Posies, Seaweed, 7 Year Bitch, Some Velvet Sidewalk, Soundgarden, Supersuckers, Young Fresh Fellows, and Zipgun, and includes Nirvana's first live performance of the grunge anthem \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Hype VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "John Mortensen", "feature": [], "rank": "65,595 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0782008119", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Stryker. Tough name, too. Stryker's job is to turn a bunch of raw recruits into a fighting machine. His no-holds-barred approach causes a great amount of friction, not to mention a running subplot concerning his personal life that makes him something of an enigma to his men. The mystery of his past is not fully resolved until the very ending, by which point Stryker is decidedly a war hero. The supporting roles of those who hate Stryker's guts, and who are inevitably won over, are played handsomely by John Agar and Forrest Tucker. Veteran film director Allan Dwan helmed this one, and used real war footage and three of the surviving soldiers who raised the flag on Mt.&nbsp;Suribachi to reenact that momentous event. An engrossing and entertaining war flick all around, boasting one of the Duke's finest, most measured and layered performances. The DVD includes a wonderful making-of featurette hosted by Leonard Maltin, interviewing Wayne's son, John Agar, and some of the military personnel who served as advisors on the film. <I>--Jim Gay</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Sands of Iwo Jima", "also_buy": ["B00BFWKE62", "B00IQAUO5M", "B000U1ZV6M", "B072ZQ1HP3", "B000O599YO", "B000O599VM", "B000KRRNA8", "B0009ML2KQ", "B000059TFU", "B0009ML2JC", "B0082LUFA4", "B000O599NK", "B000O599N0", "B000O599Z8", "B072ZMT33X", "B000O599NA", "B0007TKNGA", "0783230478", "B000O599Y4", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B001PO55LE", "B00008CMR4", "B00005N5S3", "B00008MTW7", "078322592X", "B00008MTW5", "B000O599VC", "B072ZP7HN4", "B000EHSVSC", "B000O599YE", "0783228031", "B0045HCJSK", "B000O599ZI", "B00008CMR6", "B06XGX1FKS", "B00BY0EBK0", "B00E4DJK78", "B00005PJ8K", "B000O599ZS", "B074J67TC3", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599XU", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00008MTW6", "B000O77LY2", "B072ZPQ3H9", "B000O59A0C", "B0001WTWWE", "B000EHSVS2", "B01BV7PGKO", "B074P3ZD6G", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599YY", "B072ZMMWZQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B003ASLJPE", "B000O599WQ", "B00JPUUSK8", "B00DDT0J88", "B009YX8MSG", "B0007TKNM4", "B00096S4B2", "B06XGVF3LZ", "B00004XPPC", "B0006U3SNK", "B000O599W6", "B00096S4BM", "B00LC5A9DK", "B004TPJN3C", "B00006L92Y", "B0001FVDH8", "B000O599NU", "B000O599US", "0792839730", "B000O599LW", "B0001NBMH6", "B0007TKNLU", "B00008AOTO", "B001U2FASE", "B000OT6V0U", "B00MQLQFJG", "B000NNUWZC", "B015508EXY", "B077D279GT", "B000O78L0U", "B0015D20FE", "B008A1TXMM", "B00AIQARQ8", "B002EAYDUC", "0792844017", "B00KOW4AFK", "6304696582", "B000ANVPPQ", "B00UGQ0T1S", "B003AWRMCO", "B00J11U5CW", "B06XGTG94F", "B00BWJQEFS", "B074J6CSJG"], "tech2": "", "brand": "John Wayne", "feature": [], "rank": "87,576 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B000KRRNA8", "B000U1ZV6M", "B000O599YO", "B00BFWKE62", "B00IQAUO5M", "B072ZQ1HP3", "B0082LUFA4", "B072ZMMWZQ", "B00005N5S3", "B00BY0EBK0", "B000O599VC", "B0007TKNGA", "B000O599NK", "B00008CMR4", "B00008MTW6", "B000FQ4EYM", "0783230478", "B000ANVPPQ", "B072ZP7HN4", "B00008MTW5", "B000O599NA", "B000O599VM", "B0057P4SAQ", "B000O599YE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFU", "B007KFZ7Y2", "B000O599N0", "B00JPUUSK8", "0783228031", "B00008MTW7", "B0009ML2KQ", "B001PO55LE", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008CMR6", "B077D279GT", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B072ZMT33X", "B000O599ZI", "B000O599Z8", "B007LNBRKQ", "B0045HCJSK", "B009YX8MSG", "0792839730", "078322592X", "B001BSBBRQ", "B000O599XU", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000ANVPP6", "B000A9QLAY", "B000EHSVS2", "B06XGVF3LZ", "B01DL6PBIA", "B00LC5A9DK", "B000O599Y4", "B01GWCMPUM", "B00DDT0J88", "B000O59A0C", "B0001NBMH6", "B06XGX1FKS"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$11.95", "asin": "0782010040", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Set in Germany during the closing days of the war, the film uses a little-known episode of U.S. military history--the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest--as the backdrop for the story of a battle-weary private (Ron Eldard) who is the only surviving member of his platoon. Despite his request for dismissal on the grounds of mental disability and shell-shock, he is considered a promising soldier by his superiors, promoted to sergeant, and assigned to command a fresh platoon of young, inexperienced soldiers. The cycle of war continues, and the film ends as it began--with one soldier carrying a mortally wounded comrade from a scene of devastating loss. A veteran of several war films, director John Irvin emphasizes the gritty, physically exhausting realities of combat with keen attention to detail on location in Hungary.

Powerfully told as never before, these are the stories of the men, women and children, who lived breathed, and manufactured from the power of human will one of the greatest achievements in the history of man.", "Originally broadcast in April and May of 1998, the epic miniseries <I>From the Earth to the Moon</I> was HBO's most expensive production to date, with a budget of $68 million. Hosted by executive producer Tom Hanks, the miniseries tackles the daunting challenge of chronicling the entire history of NASA's <I>Apollo</I> space program from 1961 to 1972. For the most part, it's a rousing success. Some passages are flatly chronological, awkwardly wedging an abundance of factual detail into a routine dramatic structure. But each episode is devoted to a crucial aspect of the Apollo program. The cumulative effect is a deep and thorough appreciation of NASA's monumental achievement. With the help of a superlative cast, consistent writing, and a stable of talented directors, Hanks has shared his infectious enthusiasm for space exploration and the inspiring power of conquering the final frontier. <P> NASA's complete participation in the production lends to its total authenticity, right down to the use of NASA equipment, launch locations, and even spacecraft. The re-creation of the lunar landscape is almost as impressive as the real thing and is further enhanced by the use of helium balloons to lighten the actors playing moon-walking astronauts. (These and other backstage details are revealed in the \"making of\" featurette, along with a wealth of supplemental materials, on a bonus disc in the miniseries' DVD package.) With a fictional, Walter Cronkite-like TV reporter (Lane Smith) serving as the dramatic link for all 12 episodes, this ambitious production may not be a great work of art. But as a generous and definitive example of nonfiction drama, it's full of the same kind of awe, inspiration, and humanity that led to \"one giant leap\" in the all-too-short history of 20th-century space exploration. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "From the Earth to the Moon", "also_buy": ["B001BEK8CY", "B000XJ5TPE", "B07625QJ3H", "B004GJYRI2", "014311235X", "B074Q1QKY9", "1844256839", "B01G24WL1I", "B07HSM5VQ5", "1501153064", "1439148813", "B00259HB6A", "0374531943", "0241363829", "B00004U2MS", "1426219938", "0783225733", "B0026VBOIS", "0374250332", "B071G3QMS2", "B005QW98AK", "B003C27X44", "1250182514", "1844258661", "1607964724", "0312427565", "B0006FYOTC", "B072N9GB6Z", "1785211153", "B0015NORDW", "0262039451", "B07FJ9ZNN4", "B0000062IH", "B07DKSSDDH", "B07G1XK9DR", "B00GX7D5G0", "B01CJCQGOU", "0857338285", "B07FSWK6HR", "B00OTUC5RS", "B003UMW63Y", "B00DQN6IOK", "B0038Z5SOM", "B0000DZ3EG", "B01LTI1RHQ", "B07FDNRPR5", "B07CQKKFKB", "1501163930", "B001IBIHQ4", "B07G1ZS2VS", "B07JJPY23S", "1549143077", "0812988701", "1452166315", "B07DY2HFV4", "B07G2PK4PH", "B07G2D87C1", "B07KH8W76F", "B001CW7ZZ8", "B07DKV22D1", "B07DQ3ZWYS", "B000W00Y0Y", "152479628X", "1101871970", "B01LTI1WAI", "B07D591ST1", "B07DH9CNFC"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Tom Hanks", "feature": [], "rank": "126,803 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B001BEK8CY", "B000XJ5TPE", "B004GJYRI2", "B01G24WL1I", "B00069SM28", "B00HNVH796", "B0026VBOJC", "014311235X", "0553214209", "B01C4U7NPI", "B00UGQANM8", "0783225733", "B0000062IH", "0374531943", "1250182514", "B002KGREG0", "B004ODLUF8", "B00004U2MS", "1453258264", "B000V7O0DU", "B00259HB6A", "1501153064", "0986304433", "B01LTIB07S", "0993072135", "0618619585", "B07HSK3HKD", "1588342735", "0760352623", "0857338285", "1439148813", "B073LH2P6Q", "B001O4C6K8", "B0001NBM5I", "1785659995", "0312263511", "0395670292", "1607964724", "B0016NJ4U2", "B0006FYOTC", "B00MK1RD9I", "B000CCZR7M", "1844256839", "B001JKOBMS", "0812988701", "B002A9J5EG", "B00OTUC5RS", "B00080ETMM", "1426216491", "031285918X", "0525945717", "0312427565", "B0001XARMC", "0671611011", "B00005Y6XR"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0783114222", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Anchored in the 1973 Senate inquiry into the infamous Tuskegee Study, the film uses a flashback structure to take us back 40 years as Nurse Eunice Evers (played with honest conviction by Alfre Woodard, who also earned an acting Emmy for her powerful performance) describes how a program designed to treat syphilis among blacks in the South was twisted into an inhuman study. Evers's conscience is torn between leaving her position on principle or remaining to give the dying men what comfort she can while they are systematically refused life-saving medicine at every turn. Fishburne costars as Caleb, a easygoing but ambitious young fieldhand who discovers the cold reality of the study while courting Miss Evers. Adapted by Walter Bernstein from a play by David Feldshuh, the film rises above the TV Movie of the Week mold with a complex moral structure that eschews (if you'll pardon the expression) black and white polarities for shades of gray as the doctors' initial compromises become a lifetime of lies. Ultimately that tone becomes the most disturbing facet of the drama: doctors and nurses so enmeshed in what is tantamount to a conspiracy they can find no way out, and a government that searches for scapegoats for its own cold-blooded research. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Miss Evers Boys VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Alfre Woodard", "feature": [], "rank": "372,599 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$5.99", "asin": "0783110901", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Every bit as sly and visually stunning as its predecessor, <I>Babe: Pig in the City</I> is otherwise a jolting ride beyond the Hoggetts' farm into a no less vivid but far darker world--the allegorical city of the title, which for the diminutive \"sheep pig\" proves truly nightmarish. Australian filmmaker George Miller (<I>Mad Max</I>, <I>The Road Warrior</I>), who produced and cowrote the first film, this time takes the director's reins, and he ratchets up the pace and the peril as effectively as he did on his influential trilogy of apocalyptic, outback sci-fi thrillers.", "From the opening scene, <I>Babe: Pig in the City</I> means to disrupt the reassuring calm achieved by the conclusion of the previous film. Babe's prior triumph proves short-lived, and within moments Miller has us literally peering into the depths as he sets up a horrific well accident that nearly kills the taciturn but good-hearted Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), Babe's beloved \"Boss.\" Journeying with the equally pink, even plumper Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski), the young pig finds himself in a city where animals are outcasts, staying in the lone hotel that allows pets. When Mrs. Hoggett is detained, Babe must contend with the suspicions and rivalries of the hotel's other four-legged guests. The film's G status doesn't fully telegraph the shock Miller induces: bad things happen to good animals, and Babe's new acquaintances are a far cry from his colleagues on the farm. In particular, he must contend with a cynical family of chimps given wonderful, dead-pan voice characterizations by Steven Wright and Glenne Headly.", "Miller's use of effects to transform his animals into \"actors\" is even more seamlessly integrated than in <I>Babe</I>. The sequel's production design is crucial to the creation of a complete, absorbing world, and purely visual ideas--such as a deluge of blue balloons during the climactic ballroom battle--achieve a splendor and originality that a room full of computer-graphics desktops couldn't muster. Ultimately, though, the film does more than amaze: as Babe's compassion and courage transform those around him, we're moved in ways that purveyors of by-the-numbers family fare can only dream of. <I>--Sam Sutherland</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Babe - Pig in the City VHS", "also_buy": ["0783229011", "6303939015", "0788802194", "B00003CXQ0", "B000063V14", "6303314015", "B00005TSMO", "B000667GJQ", "B00005JL95", "B00005LOUS", "B0001906WC"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Magda Szubanski", "feature": [], "rank": "109,291 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["0783229011"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$8.64", "asin": "078322561X", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

The way in which it captures a time, a place, and above all, a mood, makes this film a masterpiece. The setting is a dusty Southern town during the Depression. A white woman accuses a black man of rape. Though he is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trial is such a foregone conclusion that no lawyer will step forward to defend him - except Peck, the town's most distinguished citizen. His compassionate defense costs him many friendships but earns him the respect and admiration of his two motherless children.", "Ranked 34 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films, <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> is quite simply one of the finest family-oriented dramas ever made. A beautiful and deeply affecting adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, the film retains a timeless quality that transcends its historically dated subject matter (racism in the Depression-era South) and remains powerfully resonant in present-day America with its advocacy of tolerance, justice, integrity, and loving, responsible parenthood. It's tempting to call this an important \"message\" movie that should be required viewing for children and adults alike, but this riveting courtroom drama is anything but stodgy or pedantic. As Atticus Finch, the small-town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, Gregory Peck gives one of his finest performances with his impassioned defense of a black man (Brock Peters) wrongfully accused of the rape and assault of a young white woman. While his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford), learn the realities of racial prejudice and irrational hatred, they also learn to overcome their fear of the unknown as personified by their mysterious, mostly unseen neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant, almost completely nonverbal screen debut). What emerges from this evocative, exquisitely filmed drama is a pure distillation of the themes of Harper Lee's enduring novel, a showcase for some of the finest American acting ever assembled in one film, and a rare quality of humanitarian artistry (including Horton Foote's splendid screenplay and Elmer Bernstein's outstanding score) that seems all but lost in the chaotic morass of modern cinema. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "also_buy": ["B0010YSD7W", "0060935464", "B00VHAFZ5C", "B00KLMFUKW", "B0000DJZ8R", "B004VN7RO4", "B01LZHNDQC", "0062420704", "B07GRK1JGB", "B073MDN9NF", "B00003L9C1", "B0000549B0", "B000056H2H", "B06XCFR9VZ", "B007XF4J66", "0062798189", "B01I067G4I", "B00006RCO2", "B0045HCJ8U", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000MGTQ7K", "B01JCV3NF6", "B000TXP56C", "B01M7SPYZZ", "B00871C09S", "0764586009", "B000XJD34I", "0792165055", "B00S58LCB0", "B00013F2S6", "B000059TFO", "B00004XMV9", "B01M30AFFR", "B003NF97KS", "B00AATUZQA", "B000P0J0EW", "B01N1O5UBB", "B007N31YH0", "B00EF1PKTG", "B000BZIST4", "B00TQGGEZY", "B00MQLQE10", "B010S011KE", "B0045HCIZE", "B0057UA4BI", "B001BSBBDK", "B00005LC4R", "B074GVWHZY", "0792841409", "0062423355", "0767821556", "B00407PNX8", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000EF5NAS", "B00006ADD5", "B000056HEB", "B00006ZXSQ", "1419878778", "B009NYF2GQ", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0106QUFJ8", "0062409867", "B00005JLCI", "B071G7H8CF", "B0000JBALO", "B00003CXBU", "B00004TJKI", "B00AATV07S", "B06XGRFZKM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000083C6R", "B009C30K4W", "B077D279GT", "0446310786", "B0045HCJSK", "B0000AQS5D", "B000AJJNIG", "B079W5WP5Y", "B0000DIXDR", "0792838408", "B00B0U2SFE", "B004A8ZWVK", "B00004XPPC", "B00AATV046", "B01M03TEZO", "B0050MB5PC", "B000TJBNHG", "B004DK5CW4", "B0019UGYK0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00CUEIP56", "B07F27LFH5", "B011MUA6NW", "B00EIBO8T6", "6305428352", "B001U2FASE", "B000RPCK2E", "0486400778", "B078952HSB"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Gregory Peck", "feature": [], "rank": "31,267 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["0060935464", "B00UGQAJL8", "B004VN7RO4", "B001FBNQYA", "B01KA3W31A", "B0000DJZ8R", "B01GWDI3SY", "B0010YSD7W", "B007XF4J66", "B01LZHNDQC", "B0068FZ0GK", "B075K59FGV", "B07GRK1JGB", "B00871C09S", "B07BLJLKHB", "0062423355", "B00VHAFZ5C", "B06X91F9PL", "B00KLMFUKW", "B00BOM98PG", "B0087ZG7R0", "B06XCFR9VZ", "B002XF9C54", "B00006ADD5", "B00LDCGBNE", "B00003CXBU", "B003ZEQMH8", "B07549PFZM", "B00RJXKUOM", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005WYB6LQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B005HK13P4", "B071DGGL61", "B01MSLPUKX", "B071G7H8CF", "B00UXXSWVI", "B003X27I8O", "B00005LC4D", "0062798189", "B00004XPPC", "B00006RCO2", "B01JXSOA14", "B005SFR7YE", "B0788YKWLC", "B0000549B0", "B00MBNYVDG", "B01GWCNZNI", "B000056H2H", "B0045HCJ9E", "B001KN8WJ2", "B01EIW2RG0", "B0106QUFJ8", "B01CQOVHDG", "B0057UA4BI", "B001KXZGOG", "B001AQMBDM", "B00HUGNLSU", "B073MDN9NF"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$17.69", "asin": "0783225857", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Nameless and faceless, the killer, known by the code name of Jackal (Edward Fox), relentlessly moves toward the date with death that would rock the world.

Not to be confused with the later remake <I>The Jackal</I> starring Bruce Willis (which shamelessly embraced all the bombast that Zinnemann so wisely avoided), this 1973 thriller opts for lethal elegance and low-key tenacity in the form of the Jackal, the suave assassin played with consummate British coolness by Edward Fox.

Perhaps one of the last great films from a bygone age of pure, down-to-basics suspense (and a kind of debonair European alternative to the American grittiness of <I>The French Connection</I>), <I>The Day of the Jackal</I> is a cat-and-mouse thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until its brilliantly executed final scene (pardon the pun), by which time Fox has achieved cinematic immortality as one of the screen's most memorable killers. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Day of the Jackal", "also_buy": ["B00441GYYC", "B004OB2EYQ", "B0003JANSW", "B004IFYMXO", "B000HT3PBU", "B0074B2N58", "0792844017", "B00020X88Y", "B000PFUAPK", "B07GW2PDPY", "B0006B2A42", "B00U0SSDYW", "B000MGTQ7U", "0525535861", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B01LTHXM0M", "B00004XPPC", "B0000AMRUP", "B003AWRMCO", "B00407PNX8", "B0000AUHPB", "B00004XPPE", "B00005QCVP", "B00006ADD5", "B00B2CXASO", "B000ECX0QU", "B007N31YH0", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00096S4B2", "B001EOQCJE", "B000E5N6KW", "B00008PC13", "B073D1XJW3", "B003O7I6SE", "B0001NBMH6", "B00008438U", "B00008AOTR", "B078952HSB", "B071G7H8CF", "B004SCMM70", "B000EHSVSC", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0009UVCR6", "B000CCW2UC", "B000EHSVS2", "B06XGG697H", "B000055Y0X", "B000KRRNA8", "0792838408", "B0045HCIZE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000KJU13C", "B07DQ9M412", "B0015YY768", "0783228007", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000CCW2SY", "B07GX5PW3P", "B00066FBQG", "B00MQLQFJG", "B0007ZEOQE", "B01LZHNDQC", "B074GV1NT5", "B074J67TC3", "B0008ENHUI", "B00VX223XG", "B003ASLJMW", "0790749815"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Edward Fox", "feature": [], "rank": "19,770 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00441GYYC", "B004VQRCHS", "B00104AYL0", "B01GWCBLNE", "B000E41MTK", "0525535861", "B004OB2EYQ", "B07G1HXYGR", "B00003L9CK", "B079P95M8W", "B000RHMQJE", "B07FZ5HF4Y", "B07FHBH13L", "B07DS2NZJL", "B00UGQO6NA", "B004IFYMXO", "B01GWDW0LK", "B07DNPDJFJ", "B07F25NBPR", "6305334854", "B00026L7PO", "B07FPYV371", "B07F9CTGM4", "B07GGBPSX3", "B00005JP4N", "B07HC8LPG6", "B07DRYF9Q7", "B07GW2PDPY", "B0047DKLCS", "B07GW2N5KD", "B07FRXG256", "B07D3HD2DS", "B00827OWO8", "B07GGG4143", "B00DBE97S8", "B00005A0QP", "B07HCR2CFJ", "B07FYFYN8L", "B0003JANSW", "B07GW2P81C", "B07G27PLTF", "B00005LOL0", "B000OHZJNW", "B001BXRS4Q", "B00004Y6BE", "B07J35QDFW", "B00000K3C9"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$9.96", "asin": "0783226853", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

{"category": ["Movies & TV", "African American Cinema", "Drama"], "tech1": "", "description": ["Steven Spielbergs debut film for DreamWorks Pictures, \"Amistad,\" stars a distinguished cast led by Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey. Earning acclaim for its filmmaking and power, \"Amistad\" was honored with four Academy Award nominations including Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Music, Best Costume Design and Best Cinematography. Based on a true story, the movie chronicles the incredible journey of a group of enslaved Africans who overtake their captors shop and attempt to return to their beloved homeland. When the ship, La Amistad, is seized, these captives are brought to the United States where they are charged with murder and await their fate in prison. An enthralling battle ensues that captures the attention of the entire nation, confronting the very foundation of the American justice system. But for the men and women on trial, it is simply a fight for the basic right of all mankindfreedom.", "Steven Spielberg's most simplistic, sanitized history lesson, <I>Amistad</I>, explores the symbolic 1840s trials of 53 West Africans following their bloody rebellion aboard a slave ship. For most of <I>Schindler's List</I> (and, later, <I>Saving Private Ryan</I>) Spielberg restrains himself from the sweeping narrative and technical flourishes that make him one of our most entertaining and manipulative directors. Here, he doesn't even bother trying, succumbing to his driving need to entertain with beautiful images and contrived emotion. He cheapens his grandiose motives and simplifies slavery, treating it as cut-and-dry genre piece. Characters are easy Hollywood stereotypes--\"villains\" like the Spanish sailors or zealous abolitionists are drawn one-dimensionally and sneered upon. And Spielberg can't suppress his gifted eye, undercutting normally ugly sequences, such as the terrifying slave passage, which is shot as a gorgeous, well-lit composition. At its core, <I>Amistad</I> is a traditional courtroom drama, centered by a tired, clich&eacute;d narrative: a struggling, idealistic young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) fighting the crooked political system and saving helpless victims. Worse yet, Spielberg actually takes the underlying premise of his childhood fantasy, <I>E.T.</I> and repackages it for slavery. Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the leader of the West African rebellion, is presented much like the adorable alien: lost, lacking a common language, and trying to find his way home. McConaughey is a grown-up Elliot who tries communicating complicated ideas such as geography by drawing pictures in the sand or language by having Cinque mimic his facial expressions. Such stuff was effective for a sci-fi fantasy about the communication barriers between a boy and a lost alien; here, it seems like a naive view of real, complex history. <I>--Dave McCoy</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Amistad VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Djimon Hounsou", "feature": [], "rank": "218,710 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$0.98", "asin": "0783227272", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

When master criminal Doc McCoy (Baldwin) finds himself rotting in a squalid Mexican jail, a desperate Carol McCoy (Basinger) visits suave crime boss Jack Benyon (James Woods), hoping to strike a deal; her husband's freedom in exchange for his help in pulling off a multi-million dollar heist. But Benyon is much more interested in what Carol has to offer Once Doc is free, he and Carol escape with the loot from a botched robbery and find themselves on the run from the law, from a vengeful cohort, and from Benyon's deadly hit quad. But there's a raw force even more powerful that threatens them on their wild race for the border. When Doc discovers how his liberty was bought, the boundaries of love, lust and greed are put to the ultimate test. Michael Madsen and Jennifer Tilly co-star in this explosive rollercoaster ride of passion, adventure and suspense that WNBC-TV calls \"Escapist fun with non-stop action that never lets up!\"", "\"This is going to be the last big score, I promise.\" Famous last words--uttered by crack thief Doc McCoy to his wife--that set forth a whirlpool of deception and violence in Roger Donaldson's 1994 remake of <I>The Getaway</I>. Bailed out of a Mexican jail by shady businessman Jack Benyon (James Woods) in order to hit an Arizona dog track for him, Doc (Alec Baldwin) and Carol (Kim Basinger) flee for south of the border when the robbery goes wrong, with the million-dollar loot in tow. Following close behind are Benyon's men and Doc's double-crossing partner Rudy (Michael Madsen).", "The updated version shares not only the original film's plot, but also the added twist of having husband and wife Baldwin and Basinger step into the roles of the first real-life couple to make the film, Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. This time, however, the woman's role has been given a tougher '90s edge, with Basinger pulling almost as many punches and firing as many shots as Baldwin, compared to McGraw, who followed McQueen around in wide-eyed, silent terror.", "<I>The Getaway</I> maintains the same deliberate, neo-noir pace that made the first film taut, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere in the wide-open, desolate Southwestern landscapes. The scorching sun and heat only add to the strain, making it virtually impossible for anyone to find a dark corner or alleyway to hide in. The car chases and shoot-out finale are charged, though a secondary plot line, between Rudy and the woman he kidnaps and seduces (Jennifer Tilly), comes across as unnecessarily and incongruously brutal. <I>--Natasha Senjanovic</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Getaway", "also_buy": ["B0008ENHTY", "0767809726", "B00005JMU1", "B003PIUII8", "B002HFWBUI", "6305262268", "B07FDT8PGV", "B074P3DS29", "6305308837", "B0000AZT79", "6305657947", "B000E5N684", "B00QSHWYPI", "B000HC2LHG", "B07C5H8DRY", "6305428263", "B00DWZHTOU", "B00005QCVU", "0783227876", "B07FSRB4NM", "B06XWXJWXH", "B0727KRJWT", "B003C75IFU", "B0001FGBWK", "B07GWSQKLH", "B07GTD8F9T", "B00015YVDG", "B003P9GN72", "B000PMFS2I", "B01LTI22SE", "B00441GYOM", "B079ZT1TYC", "B07CXFD7QL", "B0748QYHVX", "B07FB7NT1X", "B079PT6PV6", "B06XGRHLF8", "B004GJYRK0", "B01IWWC780", "B004SIP8LG", "B074JD6F6Z", "B07DXSK91B", "B0001EFV7C", "B07CXDB7F2", "B074QW825Y", "B010GJM86S", "B000EEQI3K", "B00006L92K", "B074J5PRMJ", "0783229143", "B074GV1NT5", "B07BQP1G94", "B01LTHN3W4", "B0043X1FLI", "B000EZ9084", "B00008L3S6", "B00005V4XV", "B0000542CB", "B00OV3VG96", "B003YOZNBU", "B00UGPB22Y", "B0007LPSH2", "B074J6Y2BR", "B00009RDG9", "B00008CMRK", "B00008978V", "B0000AZT7A", "B00XPYGZDO", "B07615P1WX", "B06XX7VWYP", "B0008ENHTE", "B0006HBZXS", "B00004Y87P", "B00IOFN09Q", "6305213305", "B000FKO3F8", "B000E5KURY", "B004ZKKKXI", "B00092ZLLM", "B000038I1C", "B074J612CJ", "6304884400", "B000CCW2U2", "B000NQRR34", "B07C5SJSP7", "B005I0DUMC", "B00026ZD04", "B00PR9KLGC", "B002AS465K", "B074J4TLW2", "B01MT18X7N", "B0043X1FLS", "B00049QJBG", "B00PXDUJH8", "B007N31YH0", "B000C20VPA", "B004HHX9OQ", "B001KXZGNW", "B00005V9ID"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Alec Baldwin", "feature": [], "rank": "26,496 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0008ENHTY", "B0000AZT79", "B000NNUX1A", "B0006HBZXS", "B00005JMU1", "B00008978V", "B00FKONA1M", "B074J39ZDM", "B003PIUII8", "B002HFWBUI", "0790750198", "B00AQ6NH44", "B00BQK4XUQ", "0780618548", "0783229143", "0792844807", "B00004Y87P", "B074P3DS29", "B07CXDB7F2", "B00030AZCU", "6305213283", "B06XB1CNZ7", "B000HT38EO", "B01MQXUU4R", "B00000JSJC", "6305308837", "B00005JMIJ", "B01M7SPXI4", "6304806434", "0767809726", "B000QUCRB4", "B00MYMTAOO", "B010GJM86S", "B00005ATZT", "B0000YEERG", "B00015YVDG", "B002T9H2LA", "B00013RC8O", "B0795CJ3XH", "B004GJYRI2", "B0000TANUI", "B00I099K0Y", "B078FFX7YM", "B001ECDVKE", "B004GJYRK0", "B00005JLFA", "B0008ENHUI", "B00004ZBVG", "B06XGTYV5Q", "6305558167", "B07B5Y6TLN", "B074GVVQQX", "B00MRAJGDI", "B0029ATTAQ", "B00XPYGZDO", "B077ZG55NM", "B01N2TPR9K", "B00005PJ6N"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$58.93", "asin": "0783226993", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Enter into this potentially explosive mix of split-second strategy and jolting suspense set against an outstanding score by Tangerine Dream.", "Following the blockbuster success of <i>The Exorcist</i>, director William Friedkin had the clout to make any film he wanted, and he nearly ruined his career making <i>Sorcerer</i>, an ill-fated remake of the classic French thriller <i>The Wages of Fear</i>. Given the big-budget treatment that Friedkin could command, the original plot remains unchanged: In an unnamed Latin American country, Roy Scheider leads a group of four fugitives who will earn their freedom if they can successfully transport truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine over treacherous terrain to extinguish a raging oil fire. The unstable explosives could prove deadly at any point of the journey, and numerous obstacles threaten the completion of the mission. Produced under rugged conditions in the jungles of the Dominican Republic, the film is visually impressive and contains intense moments of astonishing suspense, but the specter of the superior French version hangs over every scene. This version remains a folly of directorial ambition run amuck, but for the very same reason <i>Sorcerer</i> is a film that's hauntingly unforgettable, fueled by an atmosphere of dread and the forceful powers of nature. Presented in full-screen format on DVD, the film is aided immeasurably by Tangerine Dream's eerie electronic score. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Sorcerer", "also_buy": ["B000AQKUH2", "B0003JANSW", "B000EHSVR8", "B000002OOK", "B003O7I6SE", "B000EXDSCU", "0767824555", "B004IB04NK", "B00008438U", "B005152C9G", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B0007MAO0C", "B0008ENHTY", "B00003CXB5", "B004DSCMLA", "B0045HCIZE", "B0008ENHUI", "B00097DY2A", "B074J7C8WP", "B000063UR1", "B074J67TC3", "B01LZHNDQC", "B076M95GY6", "0783226853", "B0003JAOO0", "B006W00B56", "B07FDT8PGV", "B001PYD0KM", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B01LZHCEBV", "6305999872", "B00008MTW1", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00708YU24", "B078952HSB", "B01JUMV6WE", "B00KOW4B0E", "B004ALIG4M", "B074F5Q9XF", "B0089TQ7AG", "B00003CXD5", "B001CQONHM", "B07DMGZZJS", "B072ZMT33X", "B000G6BLQU", "B0045HCJKS", "B0019UGYK0", "B00TF7KYJQ"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Roy Scheider", "feature": [], "rank": "86,542 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B01997K9LY", "B000EHSVR8", "B003O7I6SE", "B000002OOK", "B00708YU24", "B01N26GVL2", "B0003JANSW", "B07CBLSDTF", "B00097DY2A", "0061775142", "B000GI3RMY", "B008Y5OWSO", "B009GZ98HQ", "B019I74IQM", "B07HSK3GZ4", "B0008ENHUI", "B005UHF2SS", "B0045HCIZE", "B0000694WH", "B004NWPY3E", "B072ZKW361", "B07KZ4MW2C", "B004SCMM70", "B004DSCMLA", "B000S0GYRU", "B0014BJ1DQ", "B00196UTEG", "B01KGR17TY"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$13.99", "asin": "078322947X", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51G7KewpckL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51G7KewpckL.jpg"]}

Lavish effects sequences highlight this hilarious, all-star extravaganza set in Los Angeles just days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when fear of a Japanese invasion threw the city into a state of Pandemonium. Screwball characters run wild on Hollywood Boulevard as manic servicemen, zealous store owners, teary-eyed girls and bickering Nazis are thrown together in this fast-rising comic souffle that even features a sendup of Spielberg's own Jaws opening.", "Watching this director's cut, it's finally possible to see why the studio made Spielberg mercilessly hack up this comedy: it's a screaming movie (everyone screams a lot), and screaming movies do not need character development. So all those character-development scenes hit the cutting-room floor and, surprise, they were all critical to Spielberg's pace for the humor in this film. The screaming wasn't that funny then--and it still isn't--but what is funny are the reinserted development scenes, showcasing the now-evident sense of hysteria in the Los Angeles community, post-Pearl Harbor. A bunch of certified nitwits, and a few certified lunatics, act as if Tojo Hideki's entire Imperial force is just off the mainland. Actually, one Japanese submarine is, and it helps fuel the frenzy. John Belushi is Wild Bill Kelso, an insane fighter pilot, and Dan Aykroyd plays a conciliatory tank commander. Robert Stack's performance as General Stilwell, one of the best of the film, finally makes sense. Also fun for the numerous cameos, Spielberg's inside jokes, and John Williams's great score. <I>--Keith Simanton</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "1941", "also_buy": ["B00LU4URM6", "B0000A02TZ", "B0008JIJ2O", "078322804X", "B00008438W", "B006TTC5GS", "B00PWY0URM", "B0000CBY1C", "B007P9HW3M", "B074J685NF", "B01DVALSX8", "B00028HBIE", "B00014NEX0", "B000P0J07O", "B000G6BLRE", "B000G6BLWE", "B00005UEQX", "B000B5XOWA", "B00000IQW5", "B003ASLJPE", "B074J84VP5", "6305162018", "B00005N90X", "B06XGVB7P6", "B00U0WY2V6", "B002N57KG2", "B00441GYUG", "B000063UR5", "B000LBL3TK", "B07BZC5KG4", "B000K7NWCQ", "B00D3LA6AW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000055Y0X", "B07HSK3HKD", "0790757354", "B00004XPPC", "B000063K2R", "B00QMWEI3A", "B0014Z4OMU", "B010RZW2QC", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00WAJ8R40", "B00005Q4D6", "B00005O3VC", "0783228058", "B0009X768M", "B00005R23T", "B000G6BLQU", "B00441GYQ0", "B00005RDRO", "B0009UZG46", "B000EHSVSC", "B008R65XKQ", "079284646X", "B01ESNHAGG", "0767836316", "B01DBXZRGE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00UOYIYA0", "6304884400", "B000065V3P", "B00MP2FSYO", "B004QBWU02", "B074J84VNK", "B000MGTQ7U", "B079LLT6VR", "B0000A14TA", "B0053TWVLY", "6305428263", "B000A6T22G", "B00006ADD4", "B002GHHHHO", "B008874904", "B004CQZFIU", "B00IIJ9F42", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00005V0XF", "B00066FBQG", "B00XPYGZDO", "B000F1IQN2", "B000G6BLW4", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00096S4B2", "0783233515", "B06XGTHYY6", "B002GHHHME", "B003L16F7C", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00287Z18Y", "B072BQKLP5", "B01J7M44P8", "B005COLF3A", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00BTYFWE0", "B00OMC2LH2", "B01CQOVH8Q"], "tech2": "", "brand": "John Belushi", "feature": [], "rank": "10,427 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0000A02TZ", "B00CPC0KFQ", "B000063UR5", "B0008JIJ2O", "078322804X", "B00TF7KZ2W", "B00000IQW5", "B00LFHYWW4", "B00LU4URM6", "B01DVALSX8", "B006TTC5GS", "B00005JMYC", "B000F1IQN2", "B00008438W", "B000P0J092", "B007P9HW3M", "B003CRM6PA", "B0000CBY1C", "0783231202", "B00PWY0URM", "B00003CXXP", "B00009ZYC0", "B000VECAD0", "B001AQMBDM", "B00005JLSB", "B009AMANBA", "B000Z8GZYW", "6305840083", "B00008438U", "B00005UEQX", "B000EHSVS2", "B074J84VP5", "B01M7SPXI4", "B007STBUHI", "B00005JNTI", "B004QBWU02", "0783232047", "B0034G4P4O", "B000063K2R", "B00028HBIE", "B00014NEX0", "B00029RTCG", "B00005Y71F", "B0748R6G7B", "B0748TT9D3", "B000BZIST4", "B0011E5M66", "B073LWR8XD", "B00005N5S3", "B00004W229", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0072GPQNG", "B00008975Z", "B002GHHHNI", "6305428050", "B01H40H0RO", "B07GW2P81C", "B001U3ZYWU", "B07KH8W763"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0783231032", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6181U67AJvL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6181U67AJvL.jpg"]}

The hunt takes Eastwood on a breathtaking journey up the Swiss Alps with a team of mountain climbers - one of whom is the man he seeks though his identity is as yet unknown.The top-notch action film, based on the novel by Trevanian, features some of the most exciting mountain climbing sequences ever filmed.", "Clint Eastwood held the dual role of director and star of this 1975 spy thriller, which makes up for sluggish pacing with a breathtaking climax on a treacherous peak in the Swiss Alps. The plot kicks into gear when Eastwood, playing a retired assassin, is recruited back into a secret organization to avenge the murder of an old friend. He's then blackmailed into making a second \"hit\"; this time his target is one of three men who will be attempting to conquer the Eiger, a dangerous peak in Switzerland. Himself an accomplished climber, Eastwood's character joins the expedition with George Kennedy as leader of the ground crew. Shifting loyalties, apparent betrayals, and paranoid suspicion factor into the suspenseful climax on the sheer face of the mountain. This memorable sequence--for which Eastwood performed his own mountain-climbing stunts--is effectively intense, built on a standard plot of double-cross and intrigue that was intended to combine Eastwood's screen persona with the global adventure of the James Bond films. For the most part it works--it's not one of Eastwood's better films, but it's got some first-class thrills (and a sly performance by Jack Cassidy) to grab and hold your interest. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Eiger Sanction", "also_buy": ["B00SZLEM50", "B003AWRMCO", "B00005LC4R", "B0001FVDJQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B003ASLJMW", "B003ASLJJU", "B003ASLJNQ", "B003ASLJIQ", "0783227930", "B003AWRMBU", "B00000JGOG", "0783228007", "0783225725", "B06XGSKJVD", "B003ASLJKO", "B003AWRMCY", "B003ASLJS6", "B00008CMT4", "B00XPYGZDO", "B003ASLJPE", "B003AWRMA6", "B000MGTQ7U", "0792844017", "B00KOW4AZK", "B0006B2A42", "B003AT9CJ8", "B003AWRM9M", "6304698801", "B003AWRMCE", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ASLJRC", "B00KOW4AG4", "B001DJLD26", "B00006FDAP", "B003ASLJKE", "B000N3SSBW", "B002Z7FWBI", "B0007TKNM4", "0783226853", "B003AWRMBA", "B003ASLJJ0", "B071G7J7KD", "B00AEBB9EG", "B00020X94W", "B00MP2FWC2", "0792839056", "B003B3NV8G", "B0020MKTOS", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003ASLJMM", "B07G1YKPPM", "B00008K76U", "B004J2FJC4", "B006W00B56", "B003ASLJK4", "B00096S4B2", "B011MHD1X2", "B074J67TC3", "B000O599Y4", "B00IQAUO5M", "B00004XPPC", "B07FDT8PGV", "B0008ENHUS", "B000O599NA", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00000K0DM", "B014JC10KI", "0767824555", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00HETHVM0", "B00441GYYC", "B072ZNBSFB", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0000AMRUP", "B00U0SSDYW", "B0037A4ILC", "B07F5CPBPQ", "B074PPNXNJ", "B074GV1NT5", "B009POCG2C", "0792838408", "B000O599XU", "6304711891", "B000NQRR34", "B00QSOM11I", "B006H3KQKI", "B074GWVCYK", "B0029778T8", "B07BQP1G94", "B003INBNOS", "0783228031", "B07GWSQKLH", "B074J6CSJG", "B000EHSVS2", "B0015XHQT4", "B000O599NK", "B07FJ8TL1M", "B00AEFYL6K", "B0045HCJTO"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Clint Eastwood", "feature": [], "rank": "13,169 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00SZLEM50", "B00TF7KYXC", "0783225725", "B003AWRMCO", "B00005LC4R", "B0001FVDJQ", "B00KQHWAR8", "B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJNQ", "B001M9ELQ2", "6304698801", "B00XPYGZDO", "0783227930", "B06XGSKJVD", "B002Z7FWBI", "B00UGQIBS6", "0783228007", "B003ASLJRC", "B00MP2FWC2", "B003ASLJKO", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B01D9TA346", "B000055Y0Y", "B00ASDC0V6", "B07926TS8W", "B003AWRMBU", "B00008CMT4", "B00000JGOG", "B003ASLJMW", "B003ASLJJU", "B000N3SSBW", "B000BZIST4", "B003AWRMA6", "B003AWRMCY", "B003X2P95I", "0792844017", "B003ASLJK4", "B000W1SZBS", "B001DJLD26", "B000MGTQ7U", "0792842502", "1400098025", "B002M9WW3A", "B001FZQOW2", "B0037A4ILC", "B003AT9CJ8", "B003AWRM9M", "B00000K0DM", "B00TG7TDY2", "B00005M2CO", "B00UGQ5FXA", "B01GWCLR6K", "B00UGQ5X3C", "B0014VPFT0", "B00XKENZP0", "B071G7J7KD", "B0006B2A42", "B07288ZH3P"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$9.96", "asin": "0783230346", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}
{"category": ["Movies & TV", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Alien Invasion"], "tech1": "", "description": ["From the master of suspense, John Carpenter, comes a chilling new version of the sci-fi classic. Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birthand the reign of terror begins. In what the New York Times calls \"one scarifying trip,\" the people of Midwich must try to find a way to stop the children in the Village of the Damned.", "The original 1960 version of <i>Village of the Damned</i> is regarded as a classic of science-fiction and horror, and it remains one of the creepiest movies of its kind. Directed with occasional flair by John Carpenter, this 1995 remake trades subtlety for more explicit chills and violence, but the basic premise remains effectively eerie. In the tiny, idyllic town of Midwich, a strange mist causes the entire population to fall asleep, and when everyone awakes the town physician (Christopher Reeve) discovers that 10 women--including his wife and a local teenaged virgin--have mysteriously become pregnant. Their children are all born on the same day, with matching white hair and strange, glowing eyes, growing at an accelerated rate and raising Reeve's suspicion that they're not of Earthly origin. These demonic brats can control minds and wreak havoc with the power of their thoughts--so of course, they must be destroyed! Only Reeve knows how to get the job done, and his performance (the actor's last big-screen role before his paralyzing accident in 1995) grounds this otherwise superfluous remake with enough credibility to hold the viewer's attention. But for the real chills, definitely check out the original version--it's 20 minutes shorter but twice as spooky. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Village of the Damned", "also_buy": ["B00027JYMG", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00KW3A6KE", "B0000AOX0F", "B00027JYNK", "B0000AOX0A", "B00441GZ1O", "B000TUDBFC", "B0053TWVDC", "B001B8XRT6", "6305258287", "B0002C4JJ4", "B01LTHXLZ8", "B00013RC7K", "B00005K3NR", "B0021L8UPS", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0002IQLH6", "B0053TWW9K", "0792846443", "B07DPF6XTW", "B0001I55U6", "B00004TS0G", "B07GRVC36B", "B00V0CLVN2", "B0013D8LA4", "B07GRMD987", "B00A1AU72A", "B0002O7XW2", "155890848X", "B000099T3M", "6305364664", "B00JHH1W9K", "0767812166", "B0010X745K", "B014L2YKQ2", "B0001611DI", "B001O17SY0", "B00C2CDJ34", "B075B3BBHR", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00JPQ1II8", "B075FL8JWY", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00LVZK1FW", "B074ZXJQM1", "B00000IQVC", "B00005N5RM", "B000MM0LIM", "B07C2Q94TL", "B003VQZ5A0", "B00013WWT8", "B000V4UFZK", "B073ZTMJJZ", "B004I1K2NW", "B00004TX5G", "B00003CY6P", "B000RJO56O", "B000MNOX8U", "B071SB1CW6", "B073FRP1BF", "B00003CXCF", "B00003CWRF", "B001SGEUYW", "6305622760", "6305951454", "B001DJLD2G", "B002LMSWN2", "B002NZK5SM", "B000AQKU72", "B000RIWAVW", "B071FGJ3R5", "B0024FADDI", "B00004W4UD", "B0054602O4", "B00008L3U1", "B0002V7O3S", "B008R52L98", "B00005N89M", "B00AEFYV4C", "B0002CHK1S", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00006FDCU", "B00USBLX8Y", "1573624101", "6305222886", "B00S4YGV6Q", "B00000IQC4", "B01LTI22SE", "B00UA86HAE", "B00003L9C1", "B00005ATQJ", "B003VA3JUO", "B071LFWM3Q", "B00023P4TM", "B00005KH30", "B003PIUINI", "B00005O06W", "B000E5N684"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Christopher Reeve", "feature": [], "rank": "57,280 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00027JYMG", "B01LTHXLZ8", "B000TUDBFC", "B00PRIY876", "6305258287", "6305899363", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0A", "B00UTWBPBC", "B00008974J", "B07GW4T67M", "B0052DP1RC", "B00000F169", "B0000AOX0F", "B0024FADBA", "B00004Y87O", "B00003CY6P", "B074GV3X8V", "B01F6EHOCG", "B0002O7XW2", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005K3NR", "B000IMUYJM", "0792838416", "B00BNAE21E", "B0000AOX0E", "B008CYDD7I", "0767812166", "B00441GZ1O", "B000QUCQX8", "B0089BSOPA", "6305222886", "B07FJP79G3", "B001B1UO6W", "0767824954", "B002JT69IW", "B000I2J68M", "B002GHHHG0", "B00UGQ9YPU", "B0089N4GDW", "B00027JYNK", "B0002KQNL8", "B077H8N6PL", "B008BWFOXM", "B0045HCJJE", "6317570906", "B0002ABURA", "B00UGQIN0M", "B0054602O4", "0792846443", "0783116926", "B0000AOX0C", "B07G24KSBQ", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0000AOX0D", "B07JJPY23S", "B00UGQQNM2", "B000A2X3U2", "B0045HCJSU", "6304604572"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$7.10", "asin": "0783230427", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cI967U-fL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cI967U-fL.jpg"]}

A sexy, very adult take on \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" <I>Wolves</I> unreeled as a series of surreal \"fairy tales\" interwoven within the heated dreams of a young girl verging on womanhood. <I>Wolves</I>' patron saints were Freud and Jung (as sifted through Jordan's wickedly fertile imagination), and the duo are very much aboard for <I>In Dreams</I> as well. Here's a movie that takes place entirely in dreamtime, where the dark, violent fantasies of Claire Cooper (Annette Bening)--wife, mother, and illustrator of children's books--play out unpoliced by superego, conscience, or society. On the face of it, Claire's a clairvoyant whose mind becomes more and more possessed by child-killer Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.). Cops and shrinks refuse to take her seriously until she loses her own daughter and much, much more. Tapping into weird images of her soulmate's childhood, when he was abused by a hateful mother in a house now submerged in a nearby reservoir, Claire comes closer and closer to her gender-shifting bad boy (and his latest victim). From start to finish, <I>In Dreams</I> dwells in hyperreality. Whether leeched of or drenched in color, slipping eerily through an underwater world, rushing madly toward catastrophe--every hallucinatory shot is saturated with menace. It's the kind of potent, unresolved menace that haunts your waking day after a particularly unsettling nightmare. Watch this gorgeous film as therapeutic (?) theater inside Claire's mind, where she and her murderous doppelganger act out a terrible Oedipal drama driven by sex and jealousy. Bening and Downey deliver superb, risky performances, and Darius Khondji's cinematography, with almost every frame punctuated by blood-reds, is sensuously dreamlike. <I>In Dreams</I> is one of those great, flawed films that reaches for more than it ultimately achieves. But what a welcome change from the dullness and shallowness of the formulaic sure things that dominate movie screens as the 20th century draws to a close. <I>--Kathleen Murphy</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "In Dreams", "also_buy": ["B004YCKJNI", "B07B16NSK6", "B07FLG9Z7N", "0688124402", "B000N3SU92", "B0000YTOL2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B01LTHXLZS", "B010GJM79G", "B00005JNY3", "B003VQZ5A0", "B000KB489I", "B01HH7KCPG", "B074P4BGVX", "B000JYW5AK", "B07CF6WRVT", "B000JGWD50", "B0045HCJ8A", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000A3XY5A", "0783230079", "B0085KS2GQ", "B002OGMGV4", "B00003CXUP", "B0152AVXDA", "B001BPB5YI", "B000RIWAVW", "B00005AVSA", "0380720973", "B000EU1ONS", "B00022S7EC"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Annette Bening", "feature": [], "rank": "101,716 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00KQTGWPC", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005ATMD", "B004YCKJNI", "B0021L8UXA"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$7.27", "asin": "0783235410", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

What they lack in speed and agility, they more than make up for in sheer single-minded determination. Im-Ho-Tep is a case in point. He's an ancient Egyptian priest, cursed for his terrible crimes against the gods. A team of British archaeologists digs up his sarcophagus, along with a box inscribed with a warning that opening it will unleash death and destruction. You'll never guess what they do. Once freed, Im-Ho-Tep takes on the appropriately evil alias Ardath Bey and gets to the task of resurrecting his ancient lover--which will, of course, require a living human surrogate. While the premise may sound formulaic, <i>The Mummy</i> in fact turns out to be bracingly weird, relying on atmospheric creepiness rather than on jump-out-and-scare-you effects. Boris Karloff gives a terrific performance as Im-Ho-Tep. He has all the malevolence the film requires, but also manages subtler touches; the expression in his eyes as he is wrapped in preparation for being buried alive is absolutely chilling. Instead of forcing him to do all the tedious shambling around that so many mummies resort to, the filmmakers have wisely given Im-Ho-Tep/Ardath Bey a nearly living appearance once he's cleaned up and has a few psychic powers to boot, making him a potent adversary.

This sounds like the stuff of wild-eyed paranoia, but these filmmakers did their homework well--interviews include levelheaded witnesses, suspicious government agents, and Dallas cops present in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Some of the \"proof\" (especially in Episode&nbsp;2, \"The Forces of Darkness\") seems a bit far-fetched, but the sheer number of unexplained facts is riveting. An autopsy attendant describes a procedure botched by meddling Secret Service agents. A deaf-mute eyewitness shares his recollection of uniformed men hiding a rifle and leaving the site of the assassination unchallenged. Eisenhower's security chief, present at the shooting, discusses fatal safety lapses--as well as mysterious shots coming from the opposite direction of the Texas School Book Depository. District Attorney Jim Garrison points out that Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine assigned to Russian reconnaissance, operated a \"Communist\" organization out of a government intelligence office. Senator Ralph Yarbrough, present in the motorcade, tells of Kennedy's order to recall the troops from Vietnam--an order rescinded by the Pentagon three days after his death. But the most powerful elements of this documentary are the most personal, as hardened cops confess to lasting nightmares, as senatorial investigators tearfully recall the moment they realized the official story did not match the facts, and as simple bystanders share their lasting grief at having witnessed the gory death of America's innocence. <I>--Grant Balfour</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS", "also_buy": ["B00AMHFQXM", "1784184209"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Hilary Minster", "feature": [], "rank": "817,851 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["1629144894", "B00AMHFQXM"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0788600931", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke.

Like the first \"Lilo and Stitch\", this straight-to-DVD sequel focuses primarily on Stitch, Lilo, and Lilo's sister Nani.  Stitch's nightmares about misbehaving prove prophetic when he begins experiencing moments of uncontrollable badness.  Unfortunately, Stitch's unruly actions always seem to interfere with Lilo's important preparations for the May Day hula competition--a competition that Lilo desperately wants to win in her mother's memory.  Jumba goes to work creating a fusion chamber that will re-charge Stitch's molecules and purge his badness, but he can't seem to build one that works.  In the end, it's Lilo's faith in herself and the power of Ohana that offer the only chance to cure Stitch and fill his goodness level to the top.

But when Giselle begins to fall in love with a charmingly flawed divorce lawyer (PATRICK DEMPSEY) who has come to her aid -- even though she is already promised to a perfect fairy tale prince (JAMES MARSDEN) back home -- she has to wonder: can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?"], "fit": "", "title": "Enchanted", "also_buy": ["B004SIP75S", "B005LAII0I", "B00UI5CRNU", "B00M4ADWQ8", "B00005QJHG", "B00063KGPU", "B000YGGNM4", "B0084IHVGG", "B00Q7WBGHG", "B004G600A4", "B00006ZXSK", "B000AAF1U4", "B00E9ZATKI", "B01N0MCG3B", "B000F4PDF8", "B07CXZ9C5B", "B008YWY0HK", "B00795C5UC", "B001O5LVPI", "B000F2BNW2", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000TJBNHG", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00005JLJC", "B0013FSL3E", "B00AO686JC", "B004EPZ03O", "B001NP8WY2", "B0007LXPBI", "B000E8M0VA", "B00A83075M", "B00028HBES", "B013FAF96G", "B00UGR1JCA", "B000VBJEEG", "B004GJYRA0", "6304711867", "B00009XUM5", "B002CLBJPK", "B01MAZGH7Z", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMCW", "B000ROAK2W", "B06XJKXY4R", "B0084IHVN4", "B002PMA970", "B01MV0KF7V", "B00K5ZXK02", "B01LTHYE04", "B00005JLR2", "B0034JKZ86", "B071G3X2GF", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005TN8K", "B01IEBJARA", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0034GK74G", "B00K2CHX9C", "B079ZT1Y2L", "B00CTNYLQA", "B077R2WHSB", "B00BWRKVTU", "B003B1X85O", "B00005RRGB", "B004ZBACOE", "B00DWZHTOU", "B00MP2FKMY", "B00005JNBQ", "B000Y11B7G", "B003RACGZM", "B07763DJL2", "B01DNF187C", "B00AFEX83C", "B00005JPH2", "B000065V42", "B000XUOIQY", "B00005RRG7", "B005COPWZW", "1589979354", "B001ILFUD2", "B00007E2F5", "6305950547", "B01LTI0P24", "B002D0L0R2", "B00005JN4W", "B01H0O3X4I", "B001OMU6UM", "B004DK5CW4", "B07886HD17", "B0030IIZ4M", "B01I2FFJW8", "B06Y56LY5X", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000050MN3", "B000VAPZM2", "B073VS8VCG", "B01I0RFMO8", "B07984YN58", "B00004Z4SE"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Kevin Lima", "feature": [], "rank": "228,145 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00UI5CRNU", "B00M4ADWQ8", "B004SIP75S", "B005LAII0I", "B001ECPV8Y", "B01CTNDOJY", "B00006ZXSK", "B000E8M0VA", "B004G600A4", "B000VWQTXE", "B00147AJEK", "B00AO686E2", "B002ZG99KO", "B0034JKZ86", "B00063KGPU", "B01GWCIZLA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B01N0MCG3B", "B00Q7WBGHG", "B01GWBPPG4", "B00UGQ1P66", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005QJHG", "B000AAF1U4", "B01MV0KF7V", "1423163249", "B001O5LVPI", "B008YWY0HK", "B01I0RFMO8", "B0007LXPBI", "B000F4PDF8", "B000YGGNM4", "B001HN694K", "B001FB55MG", "B000VBJEEG", "B000OYCM5I", "B000ROAK2W", "B000DWMYQ8", "B01IEBJARA", "B01MRBRN17", "B00024I2Z4", "B0001V00L2", "B0007KTBIU", "B00AO686JC", "B01G4N5PWY", "B00C7JGDBW", "B00K5ZXK02", "B001UV4XGU", "B01EUBF5WW", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00007LVCM", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005JLR2", "B0084IHVGG", "B01N2PEGLG", "B00029LO0Y", "B07D5JJGSQ", "B001FAFO3W"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$9.99", "asin": "078887148X", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eDehCTBqL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eDehCTBqL.jpg"]}

Survival can look pretty goofy, as with the lizard who keeps only two feet on the ground at a time.

Neither film was a huge box-office success, but their quality speaks for itself, and <I>A Little Princess</I> has all the ingredients of a timeless classic. A marvel of production design, the film features lavish sets built almost entirely on a studio backlot in Burbank, California. The story opens in New York just before the outbreak of World War I, when young Sara (Liesel Matthews) is enrolled in private boarding school while her father goes off to war. Under the domineering scrutiny of the school's wicked headmistress, Miss Minchen (Eleanor Bron), Sara quickly becomes popular with her schoolmates, but fate intervenes and she soon faces a stern reversal of fortune, resorting to wild flights of fancy to cope with an unexpectedly harsh reality. Rather than label her fanciful tales as escapist fantasy, <I>A Little Princess</I> actively encourages a child's power of imagination--a power that can be used to learn, grow, and adapt to a world that is often cruel and difficult. It's also one of the most visually beautiful films of the '90s and creates a fully detailed world within the boarding school--a place where imagination is vital to survival. A first-class production in every respect, this is one family film that should (if it's not too stuffy to say it) be considered required viewing for parents and kids alike. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "A Little Princess VHS", "also_buy": ["0790720434", "6303241123", "630305899X", "6303326781", "6304541333", "0792145240"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Liesel Matthews", "feature": [], "rank": "87,394 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$7.99", "asin": "0790725657", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Directed by George Miller.", "A strong candidate for the designation of most thrilling action movie ever made (the turbo-charged exhilaration of its full-throttle highway chases has never been equaled), the second part of George Miller's post-apocalyptic trilogy is also a magnificently imagined movie myth. Like the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy (by that other George) the <i>Mad Max</i> films draw their inspiration from the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell. In the 1979 original, Max (Mel Gibson) is a policeman, the last guardian of civilization and order in a devastated world reduced to chaos. But when a leather-clad gang of sadomasochistic speed demons mows down Max's family, his remaining connections to humanity are also permanently severed. After brutally exacting his revenge, Max wanders off into the wasteland alone, &quot;a burned out shell of a man&quot; who (to paraphrase <i>The Searchers</i>) is destined to wander forever between the winds. In <i>The Road Warrior</i>, Max rediscovers a sliver of his shattered humanity, and a spark of redemption, when he helps an embattled colony of pioneers fight off the savages who are after that most precious of all commodities: &quot;guzzline.&quot; Max is transformed into a legendary hero, just as Mel Gibson was catapulted to international movie stardom. With its final stirring images, <i>The Road Warrior</i> transcends its genre (whatever that may be--science fiction? Western? action adventure?) and becomes something timeless. It's a great movie. <i>--Jim Emerson</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Road Warrior", "also_buy": ["B002HFWBQM", "B00CDDHI5W", "B00UAMEU68", "B00XQ142MW", "B00004Y87O", "B001VLBDD0", "B00T73AO0W", "B00000ILDE", "B00UA86HAE", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000NA1WGS", "B0002CHK1S", "B06XGTYV5Q", "B00070FX5U", "B07DKY35VW", "B00BLSJQQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00L22H3HS", "B00IZZDWKM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00005N7Z1", "B00UGQQZSE", "6305364664", "B00005V9HH", "B00015YVDG", "B0000AOX0F", "B01KP7L9H0", "6304981635", "B000R8YC18", "B004529NMK", "B008MIMWP8", "0783241895", "B074GVVQQX", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000C20VRS", "B007STBUHI", "B00OV3VG96", "B011MHCTBC", "B00MBNYMDU", "1558908846", "B0004Z33EG", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B0045HCJSA", "B004KPLVV8", "B002GHHHNI", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GVJE4", "B000P0J0BU", "B00177YA1K", "B00000G3PA", "B074J7C8WP", "B003PIUII8", "B001LMAK88", "B0000VD12I", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CY5Y", "B002GHHHME", "0767802519", "0792839730", "B00006ADD5", "B07BYWVLZR", "B000RIWAVW", "B0000CC5CS", "B074GV3X8V", "B06XGTB81D", "B00004RFFW", "B010GJM836", "B07DKMRMPT", "B002N57KG2", "B074GWVCYK", "6304711905", "B005LAIHXQ", "B07C5K7R9Q", "B00008DDSP", "B071NDY4B2", "B009YQJ322", "B000OVLBHG", "B002ZD3V10", "B002ZG999U", "B00003CXBU", "B00H83EUQW", "B074GWVCX1", "0790729695", "6305692688", "B000EEQI3K", "B003AWRMCE", "B018WXLEKQ", "B00YT8SFR4", "B00UGQ3GIQ", "B01723F80E", "6304712987", "0790738953", "B00UA86F1A", "B00081912E", "B00005JKFR", "B075KV35FB", "B01LTI22SE", "B000AM6OQ2", "B001J710Y8", "B0000VD11E"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Mel Gibson", "feature": [], "rank": "25,140 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00CDDHI5W", "B00XQ142MW", "B01LTHM35C", "B00UAMEU68", "B002HFWBQM", "B011BRT4SO", "B00Z95AVBY", "B000WBZZ2A", "B00ZWC1DD4", "B00UA10E3C", "B000NA1WGS", "B01EQD3J3G", "B075FNTLCD", "B00ZY9XMTI", "B00UGPG1NO", "0783241895", "B00004Y87O", "B00005N7Z1", "B00005N5S5", "B003XURDAY", "B000R8YC18", "B077CY72WJ", "B0002234LS", "B000C20VRS", "B00UGPJK14", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004RFFY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B06XGTYV5Q", "B009YQJ322", "B0785WY1YM", "B000GUJYI8", "B074GVVQQX", "B000U1ZV8K", "B000P0J09M", "B0045HCJ9O", "B01IN7UKQU", "B00MBNYT10", "B00SJFG6L0", "B00UGQLAIE", "B000P0J0A6", "B0013FDM7E", "B00IO9J5XW", "B0009RCPY8", "B00MBNYVDG", "B001F7MSFM", "B00005JA8B", "B0001VTPW2", "B007STBUHI", "B07288ZH3P", "B004SIP8QQ", "B0015XHP4A", "B00KQHWAR8", "B001VLBDD0", "B000R7HY0K", "B0025VLEMK", "B00QSHWYWQ", "B06ZZP4G8F", "B00008RH3L"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$14.98", "asin": "0790729342", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. Dedicated to Eastwood's mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and featuring a colorful role for Richard Harris, it's arguably Eastwood's crowning directorial achievement. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Unforgiven Snap Case", "also_buy": ["B003ASLJS6", "B00HETDQKG", "B003ASLJRC", "0783225725", "B00MP2FWC2", "B0000TANUI", "6304711905", "B000N3SSBW", "0783228007", "6304698801", "B000EOTTOK", "B00XPYGZDO", "B000XR9L50", "B0020MKTOS", "B001LMAK88", "B000055Y0Y", "B004AOECXI", "B00008CMT4", "B003UESJME", "0767817710", "B003ASLJOU", "B07288ZH3P", "B000059TFW", "B00000JGOG", "B002M9WW3A", "0783230346", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00066FBQG", "B00005LOL0", "B000W1SZBS", "B00TF7KYXC", "B072ZKW361", "B000O599ZS", "B079ZT1TYC", "B00AEFYL6K", "B003ASLJKE", "B003ASLJIQ", "B013FDBGZQ", "B06XGSKJVD", "B06XGX1FKS", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000K0DM", "B001DJLD26", "B000056H2J", "B00SZLEM50", "B003AWRMCY", "B000GFRI4K", "B00005JNP1", "B0045HCJTO", "B0001FVDJQ", "B003ASLJJU", "B01AB0DVYK", "B002Z7FWBI", "B003ASLJKO", "B074P3ZD6G", "078322592X", "B000NQRR34", "B000BZIST4", "B00005LC4R", "B00008IHAW", "0792839056", "B0010DR4BO", "B00008CMR4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00CQ9VEDK", "B06XGTG94F", "B001LRJH0U", "B01LTHMF3C", "B003ASLJMW", "B010GJM836", "B000O599Y4", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B003NF97MQ", "B003AWRMA6", "B001FZQOW2", "B00004XPPC", "B01MCWOPFL", "B0007KIFGE", "6304711891", "B003AWRMBU", "B0015XHQT4", "B074GV1NT5", "0783228031", "B000P0J09M", "B000EHSVS2", "0783227930", "B00003CXD5", "B074PPNXNJ", "B003AWRM9M", "0792838408", "B001B187NO", "B072ZPQ3H9", "B000O599WQ", "B003AT9CJ8", "B005LAIIJY", "B01KP7LAQ0", "B004SIP7TE", "B003INBNOS", "B01A53WQ12", "B06XCFR9VZ"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Clint Eastwood", "feature": [], "rank": "76,887 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B07926TS8W", "B003XURDAY", "B01M8PU88F", "B000XR9L50", "B003ASLJS6", "B000P0J09M", "B00004XPPC", "0767802519", "B003AT9D74", "B003ASLJRC", "0783225725", "0767817710", "B0771HW47S", "B002ZG980U", "B01D9TA346", "B073LWR8XD", "B01GWCFAEA", "B00001ZWUS", "B01GWDHVIW", "B072LPQR4R", "B01MCWOPFL", "B07BF2SPZ3", "B01LTHO3R8", "B01M9E277T", "B01AB0DVYK", "0800195175", "B00MP2FWC2", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B00TF7KYXC", "B00005JNJV", "B00XQ142MW", "B01LTHMF3C", "B0004Z33EG", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00004XPPG", "B01JPYUZFQ", "6304711905", "0792842502", "B00OMC2LH2", "B071YQ222R", "B077ZQMVQZ", "B000OPOAMU", "B0774D6HBB", "B000E33W1W", "B076M7SK6C", "B072ZKW361", "B07288ZH3P", "B004LWZWGA", "6304698801", "B00UGQIBS6", "B0785WY1YM", "B073WYD3CH", "B01638AXXG", "B00005B6JZ", "B0020MKTOS", "0767803434"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$15.00", "asin": "0790729644", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film.

{"category": ["Movies & TV", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Futuristic"], "tech1": "", "description": ["The Director's Cut dvd edition of Ridley Scott's epic \"Blade Runner\".  Featuring Harrison Ford, Sean Young.", "When Ridley Scott's cut of <i>Blade Runner</i> was finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makes <i>Blade Runner</i> one of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates....

{"category": ["Movies & TV", "Studio Specials", "Warner Home Video", "All Titles"], "tech1": "", "description": ["When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play the vampire Lestat in this adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel, even Rice chimed in with a highly publicized objection. The author wisely and justifiably recanted her negative opinion when she saw Cruise's excellent performance, which perceptively addresses the pain and chronic melancholy that plagues anyone cursed with immortal bloodlust. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are equally good at maintaining the dark and brooding tone of Rice's novel. And in this rare mainstream project for a major studio, director Neil Jordan compensates for a lumbering plot by honoring the literate, Romantic qualities of Rice's screenplay. Considered a disappointment while being embraced by Rice's loyal followers, the movie is too slow to be a satisfying thriller, but it is definitely one of the most lavish, intelligent horror films ever made. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Interview With the Vampire", "also_buy": ["B000069I1I", "B000TGJ80S", "B000BRBA9C", "B0050MB3MM", "B000UPGQQW", "B0085A9HU6", "B00004WG2F", "6305258287", "B00871C0DO", "B072ZNBSFB", "B00LVZJXM4", "B0002KVUKM", "B00009ZYC0", "B0000YEEGM", "0783233477", "B00004W4UD", "0783225482", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JM5B", "B002ZG97CO", "0790732203", "B00OALA8YS", "B002GSXKNI", "B003Y5H5FG", "B01MSYVLU7", "B00011CZRE", "0345409647", "B00JPQ1IK6", "0345337662", "B004QSQMKE", "B0001US62I", "B00KE7PCIE", "0783226810", "B00005K3NR", "B00IO911VG", "B004SIP7TE", "B01MRX8M03", "B000LP6KNU", "B01M9E1V0R", "B000PAAJYW", "B000065V3G", "B06XGSXD9R", "B072ZQ1HP4", "B002AS465K", "0800141806", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000P0J0B0", "B06XGTB81D", "B002O3Z510", "B001GCUO0W", "B000RIWAVW", "B00004BZIY", "B0002WZTOI", "B00070FX5U", "B000G6BLHY", "6304711905", "0394498216", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005NB8K", "B000GAKDAG", "B01723F80E", "B008QE9XD2", "B000035Z5G", "B0009MDPYM", "0767811097", "B003VQZ5A0", "B000NQRR1Q", "B07HSM24CV", "B00005JNTI", "B0013FCWUW", "B002NZK5V4", "6305428271", "B002GHHHKG", "B01I06385Y", "B001TUZG4K", "B00007BKVC", "B00003CWM3", "B001AGXEAG", "B00003CXSP", "B000K7VHLY", "B002ZG9864", "B0009A40ES", "B001KRCDSO", "B00003CXWV", "B01M7SPYHH", "B00IBKXU2Q", "0792833198", "B00AEBBA2W", "B001B8XRT6", "B002ZG971U", "6304806434", "B00009PY3X", "B01MFASCJO", "B00000K3D4", "B000EXDSCA", "B01LTHXLWQ", "B007SPPANM", "B002NZK5TG"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Brad Pitt", "feature": [], "rank": "184,926 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00UGQKSMI", "B00P0F1072", "B000TGJ80S", "B00K7BH5E6", "0345337662", "B000069I1I", "B000BRBA9C", "B00UGQICFI", "B0050MB3MM", "B00OALA8YS", "B00LZYE1Z0", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AEBBA72", "B0085A9HU6", "0345456343", "B002AS465K", "B000065V3G", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002KVULG", "B0018QPPXW", "B000092T3U", "B00111YM5Q", "6305258287", "B00011CZRE", "0800141741", "B003Y5H5FG", "0767817664", "B00004WG2F", "0316176362", "B00005YJMX", "B00LVZJW4I", "B074TLYSFH", "0345313860", "B002O3Z510", "B00SJFG6L0", "B00KE7PCIE", "B0024FAG3A", "B01M6WY6KX", "B01I06385Y", "B00009ZYC0", "0345385403", "B004SIP8MK", "B004SIP92O", "B00871C0DO", "B001W8XUBK", "B01M7SPYHH", "B004QSQMKE", "B00P9UVB1S", "B00005NB8K", "B074J6Y2B3", "B008QE9XD2", "B00EO2I6RO", "B007D5E7C2", "B00004BZIY", "B000PAAJZ6", "B005LAIHYU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00XQ8W27C"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0790729687", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

Safe from demanding kooks who pop up unexpectedly. Safe from the unknown killer stalking her every move. She's in the arms of The Bodyguard. Starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston and featuring songs from the #1 soundtrack album (including Houton's hits \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"I Have Nothing\"), The Bodyguard has it all: Suspense. Thrills. Romance. Peril. Passion. And the shining brilliance of two great stars. In her spectacular film debut, Houston plays Rachel Marron, a music/movie superstar at her peak. Fans want to see her, hear her, touch her. But one wants to kill her - and that's where security expert Frank Farmer(Costner) comes in. Farmer is a professional who never lets his guard down. Rachel's glamorous life often puts her at risk. Each expects to be in charge. What they don't expect is to fall in love<P><b>DVD Features:</b><br><b>Production Notes</b><br><b>Theatrical Trailer</b><br>", "This 1992 crowd pleaser made almost as much money for Whitney Houston as its chart-busting soundtrack. A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make, <i>The Bodyguard</i> stars Houston as a pop-music diva (now <i>there's</i> a stretch) and Kevin Costner as the stern bodyguard who is assigned to protect her after the singer receives some nasty death threats. Pop star and bodyguard don't hit it off at first, but they wear down each others' defenses, and before long Houston is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The film, written by Lawrence Kasden, was originally intended for Steve McQueen, but the script languished for years before Houston took an interest in the project. A proposed sequel would potentially have starred Costner and Princess Diana, until Diana's tragic death precluded that possibility. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Bodyguard Full Screen Edition", "also_buy": ["B000002VMD", "B00081U7HC", "B01M9E1V0R", "B000065V3J", "B00066FAVW", "B004AOECXI", "6305428409", "B008Y1YJN6", "B01I06385Y", "B009J2VR3Y", "B000KF0GWW", "B00001W9G0", "B0010YSD8Q", "0767817729", "B003AWRM9M", "B01MDLUTAH", "B00TGNLX1C", "6305236518", "B06XGRHLF8", "B00AEFYRP0", "B005LAIH1S", "B000765IJK", "B000JYW5BE", "B0000DIXDR", "B00465I1CE", "B00AEFXZ1C", "630471193X", "B01M27LILR", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0000524E5", "B000055Y0Y", "B000QUU4LY", "B00004ST9Q", "B00066FAQW", "0783240171", "6305133409", "B007SPPANM", "B002U4UYYQ", "B000EOTTOK", "0790731533", "B07JYQN7J6", "6305428034", "6305236569", "B00009WVSL", "B000CCBCAI", "B001P5HI4A", "B002NZK5TQ", "B074GTWPBD", "B06XGRJ75C", "1558908315", "B07925M5XZ", "6305213305", "B06XGCTH88", "B074J67TC1", "B000035P5I", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0006GANOQ", "0800141741", "6305505780", "B00UA86HAE", "B000P0J092", "B000A50460", "B000E5N684", "B00070FX5U", "B01MFASCJO", "B002GHHHHO", "B00009AOBI", "B000LP6KNU", "B0053XZ98M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00007E2F5", "B07GWSQKLH", "078324021X", "6305128952", "B0018RNF60", "B0081FSMPG", "B07D4ZPJ89", "0800141849", "B00015YVD6", "6304711905", "B003LMPKSQ", "B001AEF6C2", "6305428352", "B072ZNBSFB", "B000JCE3MA", "B0748YHVZP", "B000065V3G", "B004Q5JS30", "B07G1C65XK", "B001EKP5FK", "0767803434", "B06XGCTH87", "0792844831", "B06XNQHJ9L", "6304806434", "B0000714BR", "B002UNXSCM", "B005LAII0I", "B00000G3PA"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Kevin Costner", "feature": [], "rank": "29,247 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B002U4UYYQ", "B00UGR51Y2", "B000065V3J", "B000002VMD", "B076D877PZ", "B01M9E1V0R", "B00081U7HC", "B07GR8HTHY", "B000KF0GWW", "B07G1C65XK", "B009J2VR3Y", "B072ZLF77F", "B002GHHHHO", "B076DBP9DW", "B003AWRM9M", "B00B83ROIE", "B0000DIXDR", "B00066FAVW", "B004AOECXI", "6305236518", "B01I06385Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B004LUNVZQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000CCBCAI", "B0009HLD4Q", "0783223609", "B00004R84V", "B00MP2FP2E", "B008Y1YJN6", "B01M27LILR", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B000WAEJZ0", "B0010YSD8Q", "B007SPPANM", "B0002WZTOI", "B00CIOG2JO", "B000J103PC", "078324021X", "B000EOTTOK", "B06XX2XT8J", "B002NZK5R8", "B0000AOV4I", "B07BFXSB7C", "B01GWBVYB4", "B00066FAQW", "B000FVQLRU", "B00006ZXSQ", "0767817729", "B000WC3AKI", "B01MDLUTAH", "B074J6Y2B3", "B002GHHHKG", "B00004ST9Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B002CA68NO", "B01DBXZRGE", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B0000649QA"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$18.86", "asin": "0790729709", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Fugitive", "also_buy": ["B002O3Z4YS", "B072ZLN4NY", "0767803434", "B004IK30MI", "B00008K76V", "B06XGRHLF8", "B072ZNBSFB", "B00008K76W", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0006GANOQ", "B074GVWHY3", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76U", "B0007IO6NM", "B000F8DV1M", "B003ASLJIQ", "B072MMQPN6", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GYZQ", "0783225733", "B001ECDVJU", "B000CEV3M8", "6304711891", "6305428115", "B000ARXF96", "B007N31YH0", "6305236518", "B0791WFFJH", "B00AEBBA2W", "B002AT8KDI", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AS464Q", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305657947", "B01M9E1V0R", "B002NZK5VO", "6305213283", "B00008G8M4", "0783223609", "B000U1ZV8K", "B000WTVZHQ", "B07FDT8PGV", "B00871C09S", "6304806434", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B074GVWKQK", "630528072X", "B004AOECXI", "B007STBUHI", "B000O77SRC", "6305133476", "B002ZG99TA", "B004IK30M8", "B00008L3U4", "B000P0J0EW", "B003ASLJMW", "B00ALTQRRK", "B002GHHHP6", "B000EGDB10", "B001E75QH0", "B0018O4RT2", "B00066FBQG", "6305364664", "B00014NEZI", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005T7HZ", "0792844017", "B007FQXEXW", "0792844874", "B00015YVDG", "B00005JL8F", "B002GHHHME", "1558908315", "B002AT8KAG", "B0045HCJSK", "B00005B6JZ", "B0050MB5NO", "0767811100", "0790732149", "B001LMAK88", "0783240295", "B00003CXDB", "B06XGVB7P6", "B00008CMR6", "B010GJM886", "B06XGCTH88", "B00G4SHX6G", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00001ZWUS", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXQS", "B0178J7K94", "B00081U7HC", "B000A2UBN4", "B00NX73VL2", "B07925M5XZ", "B072ZCZ3KG", "B001680M26", "B00AEFYDV8"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Harrison Ford", "feature": [], "rank": "115,144 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B002O3Z4YS", "B000JYW5BE", "B072ZLVP6R", "B00008K76V", "0767803434", "B007FQXEWI", "B00008K76W", "B0006GANOQ", "B072ZLN4NY", "B004IK30MI", "B00008K76U", "B00EYA6VD2", "B00FM7NFTE", "B002NZK5R8", "6304765258", "B06XGRHLF8", "B00TGNLUSI", "6304711891", "B06XGTB81D", "B07CNC3293", "B072ZNBSFB", "B000055Y0Y", "6305428115", "6304806434", "B0045HCJGC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00000G3PA", "B002AS464Q", "B00015YVDG", "B002GHHHP6", "B008OIQYXM", "B0045HCJFS", "B002NZK5UU", "B002AS466O", "B00008975Z", "B06XNQHJ9L", "B00UGQ2LIC", "B01M7SPYHH", "B000P0J0EW", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0178J7K94", "B074GVWHY3", "B000GUJYI8", "B010GJM836", "B00005B6JZ", "B00004YA66", "6305213283", "0783235070", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBBA2W", "B001E75QH0", "B01MFASCJO", "B000U1ZV8K", "B01NCO69S1", "B002AT8KDI", "B00L3PCNGU", "0783226888", "B002Z7FWBI", "B003LR5BD0", "079284646X"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$7.22", "asin": "079072961X", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, but it does make it a mildly disappointing one, and it illustrates the hazards of crafting a film to fit the persona of its leading man. In this case, you've got Wesley Snipes, a young, savvy man of action, playing a Washington, D.C., police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a woman in the White House. The president's son is a prime suspect, but there's a cover-up underway that forces Snipes to intensify his investigation beyond normal parameters. For a while at least, this makes <I>Murder at 1600</I> a sharp and interesting film, and while the national security advisor (Alan Alda) seems highly cooperative (but don't be so sure), Snipes meets a secret service member (Diane Lane) who shares his belief in a high-level conspiracy.

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a free-spirited con with lightning in his veins and glib on his tongue, fakes insanity and moves in with what he calls the \"nuts.\" Immediately, his contagious sense of disorder runs up against numbing routine. No way should guys pickled on sedatives shuffle around in bathrobes when the World Series is on. This means war! On one side is McMurphy. On the other is soft-spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), among the most coldly monstrous villains in film history. At stake is the fate of every patient on the ward. Based on Ken Kesey's acclaimed bestseller, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest swept all five major 1975 Academy Awards: Best Picture (produced by Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas), Actor (Nicholson), Actress (Fletcher), Director (Milos Forman) and Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman). Raucous, searing and with a superb cast that includes Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd in his film debut, this one soars. <P><b>DVD Features:</b><br><b>Production Notes</b><br><b>Theatrical Trailer</b><br>", "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman's <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> emphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s, <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> really hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra's <i>It Happened One Night</i> in 1931. <i>--Jim Emerson</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "also_buy": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B073MDN9NF", "B000022TSY", "B0000YEEGM", "B0019UGYK0", "B000UJCALI", "B000022TS6", "B00003CWQR", "0792833287", "B000R8YC18", "B00005ATQJ", "B006TTC5HC", "B006FE83UE", "B00079Z9VO", "B008MIMWP8", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00066FBQG", "0767811100", "B000RTB0R6", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00UUOVIR0", "B003ELKNH2", "079073219X", "0451163966", "B01LZHNDQC", "B0087ZG7UW", "B01GWBUHYY", "B007N31YH0", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JNP1", "B06XGG4FFD", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000A2UBN4", "B000EHQU0S", "B0006GAOJA", "6305144168", "B06XGRJ81X", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009A40ES", "B000BZIST4", "B000055Y0X", "0800141806", "B0010YSD7W", "B001KN8WJ2", "B004LLIRRM", "B00005MEOU", "B06XCFR9VZ", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B00009W5CA", "B00004XPPC", "B004L9GMBC", "B00871C09S", "B00006ADD5", "B074J685NF", "B0047BXR0S", "B011MUA6NW", "B0045HCJ8U", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B06XGCTH88", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002B15XI", "0764586629", "0792838408", "B00AQ7CUKA", "B00OLZ4E3O", "B072ZLN4NY", "B000063US2", "B00407PNX8", "0792846443", "B0013D8LNG", "0767827902", "B00020X88Y", "B01MFASCJO", "B005LAIIJY", "B000A7DVR2", "B004U7MR3M", "B0045HCIYU", "0790732262", "B00004BZIY", "B007XF4J66", "B00013RC84", "B00008O38F", "B004SIP7TE", "B00005JMCN", "B074GVWHZY", "B074P3TPZV", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEBB9EG", "B01M9E1V0R", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09C", "B074J7C8WP", "B000XJD34I", "B00027JYLC", "B00003CXD5", "B000C20VRS", "B0002B15ZG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005V9HH"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Jack Nicholson", "feature": [], "rank": "19,379 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B001KN8WJ2", "B01GWBUHYY", "0451163966", "B073MDN9NF", "B000R8YC18", "B00EBBGL4S", "B0047BXR0S", "0792833287", "B0000YEEGM", "B000UJ48T0", "B0006GAOJA", "B00GMT69C6", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00003CXBU", "B01LZHNDQC", "0767811100", "B000022TS6", "B00UUOVIR0", "B0019UGYK0", "B010GJM86S", "B002NZK5QY", "B0010YSD7W", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000P0J0EW", "B0045HCJIA", "B002VWNIDG", "B007N31YH0", "B00005MEOU", "B006TTC5HC", "B01M24PD63", "B000BZIST4", "B0087ZG7R0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B01MFASCJO", "B06XGG4FFD", "B06XGV9Q7R", "B00871C09S", "B00005ATQJ", "079073219X", "B00079Z9VO", "B011MUA6NW", "B006FE83UE", "0792833260", "B002VWNIBI", "B005HK13P4", "B0001FGBW0", "B000RTB0R6", "B000C20VRS", "B00006ADD5", "B0057UA4BI", "B00009W5CA", "B004GJYRLO", "6305144168", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000LP6KNU", "B000F1IQN2", "B00AEBB95K", "B00T5DJ0R2", "B00004XPPC", "B00066FBQG"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0790732181", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

A stranger, McCabe (Warren Beatty's best performance), the film's nonheroic protagonist, rides into a dead northwest mountain town (to the mournful sounds of Leonard Cohen), possessing ambitious entrepreneurial dreams of expansion. As the town grows, Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie's finest role, as well), a tough madam, arrives and convinces McCabe to join her in a partnership. Neither are typical Western archetypes: McCabe's an insecure braggart, bumbling lover, and horrible businessman, while Mrs. Miller, hardly a whore with a heart of gold, favors her opium pipe to her partner's romantic advances. Altman, meanwhile, buries these central characters within the town's complex, richly detailed tapestry of characters, preferring to eavesdrop on their overlapping conversations and study the bleak, harsh conditions of their lifestyles. At its core, the film addresses the sacrifices of individualism needed in order to build a community, an American concept that the independent Altman views with skeptical irony. The inevitable final shoot-out underscores the theme. Because McCabe refuses to sell the town he built to a corporation, hired bounty hunters are sent. Instead of a showdown at high noon, the finale--one of Altman's most beautiful set pieces--takes place in the snow, guerilla warfare style. As McCabe runs and hides for his life, the town he created preoccupies itself with saving a burning church instead of their creator, while Mrs. Miller, stoned and grinning, detaches herself from either concern. Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond captures the town's brutal textures in luminous Cinemascope. <I>--Dave McCoy</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Mccabe &amp; Mrs. Miller VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Warren Beatty", "feature": [], "rank": "333,329 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$14.99", "asin": "0790741067", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

When Grandma refuses to sell her store to Austin Bucks, the local fat cat, Mel, determined to make a fortune, poisons a batch of the silver-haired do-gooder's famous fruitcakes with reindeer nip, thus causing Rudolph and company to crash into her while making their Christmas Eve rounds. Soon there's an APB out on Santa, named the culprit of a hit-and-run and possible kidnapping (Grandma, nowhere to be found, is sidelined with a nasty case of amnesia in the North Pole). For kids 6 and older, this video's smirkiness isn't likely to overshadow its somewhat convoluted message about the holiday spirit, but in grownups what resounds is not the anti-greed and goodwill sentiments but the degree to which society has slunk into cynicism since the Grinch's heyday.

With his spirit, smarts and determination, Jake must outmaneuver his greedy and curvaceous Cousin Mel (Michele Lee) and the all-powerful businessman Austin Bucks to the disbelief of his doting parents, rebellious sister and goofy Grandpa. All the while, it is up to Jake to save Santa from his fretful fate in this colorful Christmas mystery.

But the show's producer Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano, <I>The Matrix</I>) decides it's time for King to lose his crown and allows Diamond Dallas Page (playing himself) and assorted cronies to tromp all over the fallen King. Crestfallen, Gordy and Sean track King down to convince him to take another shot at the big time. Although in the process they discover that King may not be the man they thought he was, their faith never falters. With the training assistance of an old-school wrestler (Martin Landau), they get King back into the ring to face the triple steel cage. <I>Ready to Rumble</I> is clearly aimed at wrestling fans, who will doubtless enjoy numerous professional wrestlers playing themselves, including Goldberg and Sting, as well as the scantily clad Nitro Girls. The movie isn't exactly Shakespeare, but it has a raffish, affable charm.

John Wayne and Kirk Douglas star as a career naval captain and his self-pitying commander in the peacetime navy who are thrust into battle when Pearl Harbor is bombed while they are on maneuvers. Minutes into WWII, they are already scapegoated and demoted by the embarrassed military brass. Wayne romances a WAVE nurse (Patricia Neal) and attempts a reconciliation with his estranged, spoiled son (Brandon de Wilde) while Douglas sinks into the bottle after the death of his cheating wife until the American fleet rebuilds and calls upon Wayne to lead one of the initial invasion forces. Henry Fonda makes a brief but commanding appearance as the fleet admiral. Burgess Meredith is a former writer turned witty commander, Dana Andrews a showy but indecisive admiral, and Stanley Holloway a genial Australian scout working with the American invasion forces. Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss play newlyweds torn apart by the war, and also appearing are Franchot Tone, Carroll O'Conner, Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, and Larry Hagman, among many, many more.

Rather, they arrive back on the <i>Enterprise</i> as children, but with their adult minds still intact. Guinan adjusts quickly to being a kid again, but the others have problems. Though still a competent captain, Picard knows he can't be taken seriously in the body of a 12-year-old.

When some Ferengi hijack the <i>Enterprise</i> and quarantine all the adults, it's up to the freshly young to save the day. There are a couple of problems with this episode: it was far too easy for the Ferengi to take over the ship, and the transporter maneuvers needed to return them to adult form are never talked about as a possible fountain of youth.

Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures. <I>Titanic</I> would surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of the <I>Titanic</I> disaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turn <I>Titanic</I> into an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette of <I>Titanic</I> during its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself. <I>Titanic</I> is an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of the <I>Titanic</I> disaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact. <I>Titanic</I> is an epic love story on par with <I>Gone with the Wind</I>, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Titanic VHS", "also_buy": ["6305123616", "6303148352", "6303402348", "6301966988", "6303314015", "6300263673", "B00068S41I", "6305368139", "6303049079", "B00006HBUG", "6300214753", "6303347657", "B00000K2SC", "B000HF1Z9I", "6303637574", "6304779674", "6304117752", "6303610811", "079070546X", "6302481805", "B0000696IE", "B00003CX8I", "6301404440", "6301217977", "0792116887", "630273973X", "6304873441", "B000007OY0", "630339406X", "0788805843", "630141277X", "B000069K5I", "6303212395", "0767805267", "6302779278", "6304233639", "6301966740", "6303020089", "080010367X", "6301734734", "6304613199", "6301562143", "0790736233", "6303109950", "6304100507", "0783235968", "6302171725", "B0000214F2", "B00008G9B8", "6304258984", "6300271331", "B00004REYY", "6303909884", "078062369X", "6303257844", "B00005JKVT", "6300213668", "6300214060", "6303853102", "6303313345", "B00000JKNP", "6301390725", "0790740907", "630575067X", "6303168507", "6303506291", "6301796535", "6304025831", "B00000K3AM", "6300989003", "B00005JHB7", "6300183211", "0783214243", "0783219105", "B00003CXO0", "B00020X8ES", "079215827X", "0792153294", "6305250138", "B000005XKO", "6303534422", "0790734591", "6305587841", "B000006FYP", "B00000K3UR", "B000059XY5", "6304117272", "6304681496", "6304030983", "0788805533", "0790741628", "B00004TLMY"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Leonardo DiCaprio", "feature": [], "rank": "66,673 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B07JJ5WH61", "B00BBND56G", "B009VQHDSQ", "B00C2UN5UI", "B079ZS9M3T", "0067575161", "B00B0U2SFE", "6302201837", "6303402348", "157119665X", "B0013FSL3E", "6305368139", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000006FYP", "B00000JQSV", "B013R8D28I", "B01HEDPMXU", "B07CF6WDGT", "B0714QRG4Z", "B07HSKPDBV", "B07D5155WL", "B07BZC5KHW"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$8.49", "asin": "0792151712", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

High-living prostitute Julian Kay (Richard Gere, stepping in for John Travolta) has it all: the Mercedes, the clothes, access to Beverly Hills' swankiest establishments, and a stable of rich, older female clients. But it all falls apart after he does a favor for his former pimp (Bill Duke) and the trick turns up dead a short while later; Julian's actual client won't give him an alibi, and police detective Sunday (Hector Elizondo) doesn't believe the gigolo's denials. The one person who can help him is frustrated politician's wife (and sole non-paying bedmate) Michelle (Lauren Hutton), if only Julian could let down his defenses and accept her gesture of love. Mixing his admiration for European art cinema with a voyeuristic view of the seamier side of sex and affluence, Schrader renders Julian an inscrutable, emotionally disengaged purveyor of pleasure, decked out in Giorgio Armani clothes coordinated with Ferdinando Scarfiotti's meticulous production design. Amid critical doubts about its artiness and distanced eroticism, American Gigolo surprised everyone by not dying on the box office vine. With some audiences reportedly showing up for repeat viewings of Gere's seductive charms, it became a moderate hit, turning Gere into a star and Armani into the new fashion sensation. Whatever reservations one may have about the movie, it provided two indelible images of 1980s decadence to come: Gere's perusing his \"artist's palette\" of shirts, ties, and jackets, and Gere's cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in his convertible to the New Wave strains of Blondie's \"Call Me\"."], "fit": "", "title": "American Gigolo", "also_buy": ["B00006RCNY", "0792844807", "6305308837", "B00AEFYRP0", "B074GTWPBD", "0767809726", "B00081U7HC", "B010GJM79G", "B00005Y6XB", "B009NZXH5S", "B000HC2LHG", "B004SIP9VA", "B074P3DS29", "B074J39ZDM", "B072ZCZ3KG", "B002HFWBUI", "B06XGCTH88", "B074J612CJ", "6305310335", "B06XDHTH8B", "B000E5N684", "B06XGG4FFD", "B0030E5NJ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B005NKIPUY", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00009WVSL", "B000R8YC18", "6305262268", "6305213305", "B07FDN2LLJ", "B072ZLF77F", "B000QXDCLA", "B0017ANB08", "B00EF1PLPY", "B0002T2Z5W", "0792844874", "0800141601", "B000H5TH20", "B002AT8KAG", "B074J5X1JV", "B00008L3S6", "B01DW7GYVG", "B06XGV2VPQ", "B00005V9HH", "B0788XVFP1", "B00008RV1F", "B074J6Y2BR", "B07G14XPRR", "0792833287", "B00008CMRK", "B00MYMTAGM", "B0043X1FNQ", "B074J39ZD5", "B000022TSY", "B0009R1TI6", "B074J5PRMJ", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00008MTW2", "B01M9E1V0R", "B075DQ8R7F", "0767817648", "B07D4ZPJ89", "B07GVYD6HB", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JP4J", "0767817729", "B01N19Z7VM", "B00708YU24", "B07CZFPYX9", "0800141741", "B0000DIXDR", "B00005K3NR", "B06XGSXD9R", "B001P9KGK4", "B00EF1PKTG", "B0788XVVFK", "B0031RAOVY", "B0006IIPM6", "B0000A14TA", "0783229364", "B004CQZFIU", "B0011B9W7E", "B07BZC5KG4", "B00007E2F5", "B00R9HWXRK", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B000JCE3MA", "B0045O2PF0", "B004SEUJBE", "B0767FCYDP", "B07FGT8HTY", "B00007G1VB", "B0002WZTOI", "B07894WXX6", "B077TCG2JZ", "0767827902", "0783114907", "B07GJFS31Y", "B000K2UVZM"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Richard Gere", "feature": [], "rank": "135,760 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00AEFYRP0", "B072ZLF77F", "B00081U7HC", "0792844807", "B01GWC34N4", "B00AMSS3UO", "B074J39ZDM", "6305308837", "B07FFFF5H7", "B0028N6CYK", "B00005Y6XB", "B00009WVSL", "B074P3DS29", "B01N19Z7VM", "B074GTWPBD", "B01M9E1V0R", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00006RCNY", "B06XSG5TZG", "0792844874", "6305161879", "B074J39ZD5", "B000RTB0R6", "B072ZCZ3KG", "B010GJM79G", "B002HFWBUI", "B06XGCTH88", "6305213305", "B000R8YC18", "B004SIP9VA", "B07KH1YTTL", "B072ZLVP6R", "B0028OH568", "B00BNAE21E", "B07DY2M7TP", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0000DIXDR", "B073MDN9NF", "B06XDHTH8B", "B00008RV1F", "B079FGMFDJ", "B001AEF6C2", "6305310335", "B000069HZO", "B00003CXB5", "B008R65XOM", "B000065V3H", "B0021L8V0M", "B01LTHMF3C", "B00UGPEHP8", "B074GV846G", "B0045HCIYU", "B0041ONFKS", "B000HC2LHG", "B074J5PRMJ", "B00Q599A8S", "B0009298N4"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$14.99", "asin": "0792160347", "imageURL": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qe00qgDVL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "imageURLHighRes": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qe00qgDVL.jpg"]}

All this hot stuff guarantees you a LAVA BLAST! - just one of the AMAZING PLANET adventures available from National Geographic Kids Video.", "This <I>Amazing Planet</I> video finds Captain Rip Rayon and his crew landing on Earth near an erupting volcano, and boy is it hot! As these intergalactic explorers tour volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, Pacific Ocean, Caribbean, and Iceland, they encounter orifices that blast ash and noxious gasses and others that ooze lava. Orb, a computerized crew member, explains the differences between these two types of volcanoes and also describes the Earth's three layers. She dispels the common misconception that lava comes from Earth's core, explaining that it actually comes from just beneath the surface in the mantle. Orb also discusses the movement of plates beneath the Earth's surface, magma chambers, and the different types of lava, and describes the study of volcanoes and our attempts to predict eruptions.", "Fantastic footage of real eruptions is broken up with comic interludes such as a rap-style report to Admiral Lump and a \"Bubble Zipple\" commercial that Orb uses to liken the bubbles in soda pop to the pressure building within a volcano. Orb asserts that 500 million people live near volcanoes, explaining that they reap the benefits of rich, fertile soil and often build power plants to convert volcanic heat into usable energy.

Nelson and JoBeth Williams as a California couple swept up in a wave of horror after sinister spirits invade their home and kidnap their child. Year: 1982 Director: Tobe Hooper Starring: Craig T. Nelson, Jo Beth Williams, Beatrice Straight", "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to make <i>Poltergeist</i>. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg's <i>E.T.</i>, it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.) Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the original <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>, which came along two years later, <i>Poltergeist</i> is one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time. <i>--Jim Emerson</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Poltergeist", "also_buy": ["B00V0CLVN2", "B0118S6ZRE", "B003UGLCIA", "B00009PY4G", "B004SIP92O", "B00005K3O4", "B0045HCJJE", "B01JCUMC8G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006FDCD", "B0152AVXDA", "B000HCO86I", "B00006ADD4", "B001B1872U", "B00000IQC4", "B002KH4KSY", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00302QF72", "B00S4YGV6Q", "B0021L8UFI", "B000050GOI", "B074J612DP", "B00004BZIY", "B076CVQ2RH", "B01I06C2EW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00D7AM6M0", "B001BSBBGC", "B01MSYVLU7", "B001AGXEAG", "B00L8QP0XM", "B003VJJETA"], "tech2": "", "brand": "JoBeth Williams", "feature": [], "rank": "102,267 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B00V0CLVN2", "B0118S6ZRE", "B000050GOI", "B00WICCVKK", "B000A6C28M", "B003UGLCIA", "B00009PY4G", "B00004TS0J", "B07342R182", "B01JCUMC8G", "B00V0CLXCQ", "B00006FDCU", "B00005K3O4", "B000HCO86I", "B00IYJRIKO", "B007STBUHI", "B002JT69IW", "B000VECAD0", "B004SIP92O", "B000GJ0KSM", "B01297Z6XC"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$17.50", "asin": "0792833201", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

And that's perhaps the most believable aspect of the whole movie.

Swayze had complained about being typecast as beefcake when this was made, but that didn't stop him from revealing as much skin as possible--even guys like him, as revealed in a luridly seedy scene in which one of Wesley's goons tells Dalton that he reminds him of the kind of boyfriend he had in prison (albeit in much saltier terms).

A survivor of the Borscht Belt tradition of stand-up comedians, Buddy's quick with a one-liner but clueless about how to treat people--he's like a cross between George Burns, Milton Berle, and a rabid pit bull. Helen Hunt plays Buddy's tolerant new agent who's been hired to revive his lagging career, but the movie's saving grace is David Paymer's Oscar-nominated performance as Buddy's much-maligned brother, who's helpless to stop Buddy's downward spiral. Having invented the Buddy Young character for his own comedy routines, Crystal knows this comic curmudgeon inside and out, and his show-biz savvy adds much-needed authenticity under layers of phony-looking old-age makeup. The movie works best when it's offering insight into Buddy's lifetime of disappointment, and some of the dialogue is memorably sharp. Crystal can't resist a seemingly forced happy ending, however, and the closing scenes resort to sentimentality that clashes with the rest of the movie. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Mr. Saturday Night VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Sage Allen", "feature": [], "rank": "597,255 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$1.99", "asin": "0792836618", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

When Frank's successful career comes to the attention of an avuncular syndicate boss (Robert Prosky), Frank is offered (and accepts against his better judgment) a deal that should allow him to retire and enjoy the family life he covets. But the deal sours, and Frank is left to decide what his nature truly is, lone wolf or family man. <I>Thief</I> melds its jazzy visual style with heightened realism: the jewel thief's tools of the trade are authentic, up to the 8,000 degree thermal lance used to cut through a nearly impregnable safe. Some of the bit parts are played by real-life, highly successful jewel thieves, who acted as consultants. And their presence informs the superb dialogue, as every word rings true. In one long, engrossing scene, James Caan gradually persuades the woman he wants to start a family with (Tuesday Weld in one of her most affecting performances) that they should be together.

O'Brien's book (this was the first feature Bluth made after leaving Disney to protest the studio's allegedly lowered animation standards), this straight-to-video sequel offers far poorer art and thinner characterizations. The story finds Timmy (voiced by Ralph Macchio), son of the Jonathan Brisby character from <I>The Secret of NIMH</I>, leaving the family farm and heading to Thorn Valley, where the rats of NIMH live. There, Timmy seeks a path in his father's footprints to become a hero and meets a girl mouse who tells him her parents are among some NIMH mice wrongly presumed dead for years. A rescue ensues, of course, in which Timmy and the refugee rats risk getting caught themselves. The film is about an hour in length, and genuine entertainment is at a premium in this production, making it even harder to ignore point-by-point comparisons between <i>NIMH 2</i> and its predecessor--especially when those comparisons, time and again, find the sequel wanting. The very best element here is the vocal and singing performance by Eric Idle as the villain, Martin, who resorts to electric shock to \"improve\" his intelligence and whose song, \"Just Say Yes,\" is a real highlight. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "The Secret Of NIMH 2 - Timmy To The Rescue VHS", "also_buy": ["6303206204", "6303499465", "6303144837", "6304101147", "B00004REYY"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Dom DeLuise", "feature": [], "rank": "148,751 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["6303206204"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$11.00", "asin": "0792839420", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built.

Written by Scott Rosenburg (Con-Air) and featuring a hip soundtrackfrom the hottest bands around, this \"clutch-your-armrest thriller\" (Teen People) will pull you into the undercurrent of a deranged high school cliqueand drag you away screaming! Achieve, be excellent...and be afraid. For when the esteemed Blue Ribbon club of Cradle Bay High take their slogans too far, things in the small coastal town begin to go wrong. Dead wrong. And when a \"dark sinister force\" begins turning the school's curricularly challenged into the soulless, academic elitethree \"outsiders\" join in a desperate race to avoid becoming insidersand losing their individuality forever!", "This paranoia-fueled thriller, more intelligent and imaginative than you would have reason to believe, owes a huge debt to <I>The Stepford Wives</I> with its premise of a goody-good high school clique programmed by an evil doctor to be wholesome, academically driven, and shining examples of clean living. Unlike its predecessor, though, David Nutter's film opts to open up its premise for everyone to see, diluting the scares but amplifying the creepy atmosphere. There's never any question of what's happening to the students of Cradle Bay High, who go from being druggies and sex fiends to the academically excellent Blue Ribbons, but it's a lot of fun to see these programmed teens run amok--and start killing people--when their hormones kick in. And considering they're all horny teenagers, this happens, oh, at least a few times a day. Model-perfect James Marsden, with stunning cheekbones and piercing blue eyes, is the new kid in town who stumbles on the plot with a little help from metalhead Nick Stahl. Moody Marsden stirs up trouble when he refuses to join up with the Blue Ribbons, prompting his concerned parents to consider signing him up for the program, especially after it turns Stahl into a vest-wearing, pep-rallying brainiac. The satire isn't entirely fulfilled (the evil kids hang out at the yogurt shop and spout inspirational platitudes), but once the action kicks in it's quite an enjoyable ride, thanks primarily to Bruce Greenwood (of <I>The Sweet Hereafter</I>) as the mad scientist behind it all and Katie Holmes (<I>Go</I>) as Marsden's love interest. Refusing the advances of the star football player and fighting gamely alongside Marsden, Holmes manages to deck a few bad guys with a fervor that squarely puts her in Linda Hamilton and Jamie Lee Curtis territory. With Steve Railsback as the colluding chief of police and Dan Zudovic as a janitor with a penchant for getting rid of \"rats,\" rodent and otherwise. <I>--Mark Englehart</I>"], "fit": "", "title": "Disturbing Behavior VHS", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "James Marsden", "feature": [], "rank": "201,633 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["6303954138"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$10.99", "asin": "0792840119", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Believing it takes one to know one, the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a demented prisoner who may provide clues to the killer's actions. That prisoner is psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a brilliant, diabolical cannibal who agrees to help Starling only if she'll feed his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. As their relationship develops, Starling is forced to confront not only her own hidden demons, but also an evil so powerful that she may not have the courage or strength to stop it!", "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (<I>Melvin and Howard</I>, <I>Something Wild</I>), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (<I>Caged Heat</I>), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up.

Though the Law of Diminishing Returns inevitably applies to the theatrical trilogy, the central premise is so strong that each of the lesser sequels has at least a few moments worth catching. That's because the original (wherein Detroit cop Peter Weller, killed in the line of duty, gets transformed into a crime-fighting cyborg) set up an entire world.

The film is rather underrated; sure, there are fewer ads and newsbreaks this time around, but there are several inventive touches--Robocop is briefly reprogrammed into a homily-spouting Dudley Do-Right; drug dealers step in to bail out the financially strapped city--and the villains (including the most foul-mouthed, amoral 12-year-old in movie history) are less outrageous than in the first installment. <I>Robocop&nbsp;3</I>, however, is profit-driven hash.

If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i>"], "fit": "", "title": "Jerry Maguire", "also_buy": ["B0000YEEGM", "B000065V3G", "B072ZNBSFB", "B0002WZTOI", "B000GAKDAG", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "0767811100", "B01M7SPYHH", "B004SIP7ZS", "0790732203", "B00081U7HC", "B000XJD33O", "B001KRCDSO", "B00003CXFV", "B01M9E1V0R", "B00004BZIY", "B0000AOV4I", "B00009ZYC0", "B000035Z5G", "B007SPPANM", "B00003CXQS", "B001TUZG4K", "0800141806", "B01MFASCJO", "0783226810", "B00MEQUNZ0", "B00007BKVC", "B0002V7ON8", "B00USBLWYY", "B002ZG9864", "B004SEUJK0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00008DDSP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B07JYQN7J6", "B06XGRHLF8", "B000056VP4", "B07C9D8SZ8", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305368171", "1404935770", "B0068FZ0GK", "B07FDT8PGV", "B06XGVB7NK", "B00DDT0JB0", "B06XGG4FFD", "B01K205QAQ", "B00003CWRX", "B002K0WBXW", "B0029KS7W2", "B06XGCTH88", "B01GWBVYB4", "6305428034", "6305128952", "B00015YVDG", "B000023VTP", "B000035Z22", "B01MCWOPFL", "B00007E2F5", "6304765266", "B00005JNTI", "B0001GF2CE", "B0010YSD8Q", "B0007IO6NM", "B01M9E277T", "B000053VB4", "B00JFWCFZC", "B00447L4KA", "6305144168", "B01M5EED9Y", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00001ZWUS", "B000QUU4MI", "078324021X", "B0006IJ5PM", "B00AFEY354", "B0000524E5", "B000G6BLHY", "0783235070", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEFYDV8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000FVQLRU", "B07925M5XZ", "6305236569", "B0791WFFJH", "B07615P1WX", "B002AT8KD8", "6305236518", "B00005OLYF", "B0000524E4", "B004AOECXI"], "tech2": "", "brand": "Tom Cruise", "feature": [], "rank": "18,579 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": ["B0000639FE", "B06XFZ4LM2", "B000065V3G", "B072ZNBSFB", "B00005B6JZ", "0792833260", "B00AEFXR1K", "B0018QPPXW", "B000GAKDAG", "B0000YEEGM", "B0002WZTOI", "B00009ZYC0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "0767811100", "B01M9E1V0R", "B01MFASCJO", "B07615P1WX", "B003HKN52U", "B00081U7HC", "B0068FZ0GK", "B007SPPANM", "B00T4H4E3E", "B001680M26", "B000PAAJYW", "B0006GANOQ", "B000056VP4", "B002O3Z510", "B01LTHP0MK", "B00UGQ3GIQ", "B000035Z5G", "B00000G3PA", "079284646X", "B008JFUO36", "B01M7SPYHH", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0000AOV4I", "B00007E2F5", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0001GF2CE", "B000XT1P3E", "B0038N9WKU", "B0000524E5", "B00RNTYJH6", "B00BEIYP1W", "6305128952", "B01MDLUTAH", "B019T8QBR4", "B004QSQMKE", "B00004W221", "0792843592", "B00004D37G", "B000BKVQS4", "078324021X", "B00000K3UU", "078324228X", "B0019UGYK0", "B00009WVSL"], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "$9.36", "asin": "0800141741", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

Will Tim and Mary make it out before nightfall? A hungry T-Rex hopes they don't!", "The amazing Dinamation Dinosaurs make this live-action video a spectacular adventure where towering dinosaurs roam free, just as they did millions of years ago, except that now...<i>you are there!&#60;/&#62;", "Written by Geoffrey T. Williams and based on his best-selling series of Dinosaur World children s books.", "One of the most brilliantly entertaining short family films ever put on video tape. It features a family of four who visits a dino-filled zoo called Dinosaur World. In the parallel universe in which this movie takes place, dinosaurs still exist, but they are confined to only this one zoo. The movie opens in, ten year old, Tim's dinosaur themed bedroom (perhaps the same Tim from Jurassic park). Tim fills his backpack with everything he could need including food, water, flashlight and a compass. Tim's younger sister Mary belittles him, &#34;It's a park, it's not an African jungle or something&#34;. Tim hastily exclaims, &#34;There aren't any animals in Africa with teeth the size of stake knifes! I'm ready for anything!&#34; This is a film that was written for the young ones. I was seven when I first saw it, and I got tons of enjoyment out of it (and still do). Sure the dinosaur animatronics don't exactly look real, but kids in the nineties didn't care and they probably still don't. Upon entering the park an employee warns them, &#34;Stay on the marked paths and please don't feed the dinosaurs&#34;; of course this is a grim joke; by &#34;don't feed the dinosaurs&#34; she clearly means &#34;don't get eaten&#34;. The video is certainly more humorous than it is scary, because even the idea of being eaten by dinosaurs is handled quite lightly. &#34;Visitors eaten this year: 0&#34; says one big sign at the front of the park. The family's first stop is at a hat stand, where the low-IQ mother is persuaded into buying a ridiculously large hat under the impression that a flying pteranodon might defecate on her head. &#34;There's enough room under my hat for all of us incase any pteranadon's dive-bomb us&#34;, this is the first mention of pteranodon poo in the film, though certainly not the last. At that point we see the first dinosaurs on the tour, which Tim educates his family (and ours) about. In fact, Tim knows everything about dinosaurs, more than any ten year old should ever know. But like most ten year olds, Tim just wants to see the Tyrannosaurus-Rex. Next stop, the restaurant; this is the highlight of the film. Every food item is named after a dinosaur: brontosaurus burgers, parasaurolophus punch and pachycephalosaurus soup are among the many items on the menu. &#34;I don't want to eat a dinosaur&#34; Mary says. &#34;Nobody's eating dinosaurs, they're rare and endangered, besides they're just too hard to catch&#34;. Suddenly, and without warning the waiters and waitresses sing a song about all the dinosaur themed menu items. It's hilarious. In fact, I love it so much that I memorized the whole thing. Then Tim and Mary wonder off to find the T-Rex, but they get lost. Hence the title, &#34;Lost in Dinosaur World&#34;. When Tim's compass breaks, the kids have no way of getting back to mom and dad, and it's getting closer and closer to feeding time and their inevitable confrontation with the T-Rex. I give this video a five out of five. It looks fake, but you get what you pay for. Best penny (plus shipping) I ever spent. --B.

One hundred years later, the legacy of this dream continues to define Utah. The spirit of the pioneers&#39; endurance, progression, and hope is the Utah experience of both yesterday and today. Celebrating the centennial anniversary of Utah&#39;s statehood, KUED-Channel 7 presents an unprecedented documentary series, Utah: The Struggle for Statehood.

It was written and directed by Ken Verdoia. Three years in the making and filmed on location in four states, Utah: The Struggle for Statehood captures the Utah experience through archival photographs, original footage and historical re-creation, interviews with historians and writers, and moving written records of early Utah settlers brought to life through more than 200 speaking roles. The program is narrated by Verdoia and features the music of the Deseret String Band, pianist Bob Waldis and local singers, as well as a powerful theme created by Utah composer Tulley Cathey. Verdoia says the series&#39; central message of pursuing dreams is one of relevance to all Utahns. The unwavering dream of the early Utahns is a lesson for all of us -- whether we lose a job, whether our child isn&#39;t doing well in school, whether we face some adversity we never could have envisioned in our lives, or whatever the challenge might be.</P><P>If you are a teacher in Utah, you can&#160;download this entire program&#160;(broken into usable segments) from Utah&#39;s Online Library and Utah Education Network&#39;s eMedia Service.&#160;</P></DIV>"], "fit": "", "title": "Utah: The Struggle for Statehood", "also_buy": [], "tech2": "", "brand": "Ken Verdoia", "feature": [], "rank": "645,102 in Movies & TV (", "also_view": [], "main_cat": "Movies & TV", "similar_item": "", "date": "", "price": "", "asin": "0874809770", "imageURL": [], "imageURLHighRes": []}

The Obama phenomenon is a hoax carefully crafted by the captains of the New World Order. He is being pushed as savior in an attempt to con the American people into accepting global slavery. We have reached a critical juncture in the New World Orders plans. Its not about Left or Right: its about a One World Government. The international banks plan to loot the people of the United States and turn them into slaves on a Global Plantation. Covered in this film: who Obama works for, what lies he has told, and his real agenda. If you want to know the facts and cut through all the hype, this is the film for you. Watch The Obama Deception and learn how: Obama is continuing the process of transforming America into something that resembles Nazi Germany, with forced National Service, domestic civilian spies, warrantless wiretaps, the destruction of the Second Amendment, FEMA camps and Martial Law. Obamas handlers are openly announcing the creation of a new Bank of the World that will dominate every nation on earth through carbon taxes and military force. International bankers purposefully engineered the worldwide financial meltdown to bankrupt the nations of the planet and bring in World Government. Obama plans to loot the middle class, destroy pensions and federalize the states so that the population is completely dependent on the Central Government.

Creating this video was almost as exciting as my own encounter with these remarkable new skis. I worked with a handful of great skiing friends--all of them, like me, absolutely smitten, totally converted and enthusiastic about these new skis. I asked my gifted cameraman, Edgar Boyles, to zoom in, closer than ever, on what takes place between our skis and the snow. Edgar outdid himself and produced, I think, the clearest, most revealing shots of ski-snow interaction I've ever seen. I'm hoping that his exceptional cinematography, together with my explanations, will give you a fresh vision of what really happens down at the snow level, where skier meets mountain.<P> Just as I did for my previous video ski lessons, in this booklet I want to offer you a few more tips, a few practical suggestions on how you can get the greatest benefit from this new <i>Breakthrough on Skis</i> videotape.<P> Let me start with a bold statement: I think these new skis are the most important development in skiing in the last twenty years. A lot of skiers whom I've skied with and worked with recently have told me they weren't very eager to switch to the new super-sidecut skis. \"What's wrong with my old skis?\" they asked. \"They turn great. I really love them.\" The answer is simple. There is nothing wrong with older, traditionally designed skis. But the new skis, if treated right, open the door to a level of on-snow performance that, previously, skiers could only dream about but never really achieve. In my own case, I know I'm skiing better today, on super-sidecut skis, than I ever thought I could...and I was an expert skier to begin with.<P> Besides, this new design for skis--significantly wider at the tip and tail, and proportionately narrower at the center or waist--is her to stay. These skis are not a fad. This is the way skis are now being designed and built. Sooner or later, you will be looking for new skis, and when you do, you'll find that traditional ski designs will have virtually disappeared.<P> The reason that this new design for skis has won such widespread acceptance is simple. Deep-sidecut skis really do make everything easier.", "In this third video in a 1998 set produced by veteran skiing instructor Lito Tejada-Flores, the focus is on the newer \"shaped\" skis and special techniques that can make a skier an expert when using them. Utilizing films of himself and others on the slopes, Tejada-Flores shows a series of drills that a student can practice to get the most out of modern skis. The emphasis is often on the role played by the \"inside\" and \"outside\" foot during a turn, and close-ups of a skier's feet are used to show clearly how the weight should shift during a turn. Special drills are shown, including one in which a skier is instructed to skate on skis while concentrating on how the feet must move and the body's weight must shift to keep moving forward. The lessons are very detailed, yet they also often have a poetic nature to them, such as when an expert skier is shown moving gracefully downhill while Tejada-Flores explains the \"subtle, almost invisible, foot action\" on display. The lessons on this video alone won't make someone an expert on the slopes, but the material is presented in a manner that is easy to remember, and if a viewer puts the lessons to use when on her skis, her performance is sure to improve. Also included is a booklet that essentially duplicates the information on the video. <I>--Robert J.

{"category": ["Movies & TV", "Independently Distributed", "Documentary"], "tech1": "", "description": ["Hacking vindicated! Within the computing, hobbyist, creative design, and invention communities, as elsewhere, hacking has always been a positive thing, but the media and the less than knowledgeable computer security community co-opted the term and the concept, and the media embraced it because it was easier to tell than the truth. But now the misnomer has been torn away by the honesty of a new filmmaker, Ashley Schwartau, who has taken the direct approach to getting at the truth. Observe and ask the people involved. And the truth looks more like students in engineering school and their adult counterparts who never gave up the vision of rugged individualism combined with a sense of community that brought the world out of ignorance and into the information age. Enlighten yourself, and watch this movie. Then send your kids to join the industrious, interested, amazed, joyous, freeing crowd of investigative inventors in the Internet and elsewhere - the hackers! --Fred Cohen<br /><br />Sometimes, just when your faith in &#34;kids today&#34; has been drained so bad your mind feels like a purple slurpee being rudely slurped by an obnoxious kid who is kicking the bottom of your airline seat as you ride the plane to nowhere in ever-widening circles, something comes along to renew your hopes for the future. A case in point? The debut documentary from a talented young director Ashley Schwartau: Hackers are People Too. (A.k.a. H4CK3RS Are People Too for the folks who are 3Lit3 or HAPT for those who are into the whole brevity thing.) The &#34;hope renewed&#34; impact of this documentary hit me on two levels. First and most importantly, HAPT delivers a fresh take on what it means to be a hacker. Schwartau eschews traditional media fear-mongering in favor of the classic definition of hacker: people who like to mess with technology, not to mess it up, but to tune it up, to deconstruct, understand, and re-animate everything from phones to computers to radios and doorlocks and robots. Sure, there are people who break computers and the law, but as one of the many articulate interviewees in HAPT asserts, it makes more sense to call those people computer criminals than to appropriate a word which champions of industry like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were once proud to own. By taking a positive approach, Schwartau is able to give her audience a rare glimpse of the breadth and depth of talent that is part of the hacking community. We can plainly see that hackers come in all shapes and sizes although most seem to share two characteristics: above-average intelligence and above-average tolerance for people who are &#34;different.&#34; Sure, there are some snarky smart-ass remarks--the movie would have been unbelievable without a smattering of those--but on the whole we see hackers for what they are, relatively likable people. And if that observation sounds too simplistic to be a revelation I suggest you a. watch some traditional media portrayals of hackers and see just how distorted they are, b. hang out, as I have, at some hacker gatherings. As I argued many years ago in a debate at a major security conference, these kids are not amoral sociopaths, they have their own set of morals, some of which, such as tolerance, our society could use more of. The style of Hackers Are People Too is direct and largely un-narrated, with Schwartau letting the subjects speak for themselves (which they sometimes do with considerable flair). She paired some interviewees in ways that prove effective and engaging, offering a break from solo talking heads. I also like that there are no fancy graphics grafted on to the interviews (after all, the world of hacking is historically one of monochrome command line text interfaces). There is a nice real world feel to the interviews and a refreshing lack of window dressing. The occasional use of on-screen footnotes to explain some terminology was helpful without being condescending; if you're a geek you probably won't need them, but you shouldn't diss them--this is a film that could reach a lot of people who would ordinarily shun a subject as geeky as hackers. Who knows, some minds might even be changed, for the better. The first public outing for Hackers Are People Too is a premiere event on August 8th at DefCon in Las Vegas. Look for it on DVD shortly thereafter. You can find the trailer on YouTube right here. You can also check the web site. --Stephen Cobb<br /><br />Avoiding the technical aspect of the topic altogether, 'Hackers Are People Too' instead shows you the human side of the hacker community, introducing the viewer to an influential but irreverent subculture that flies largely under the radar. It's funny, enlightening, and entertaining all at the same time, and when it's over you'll have a completely new perspective on your friendly neighborhood hacker. --Matt Lewis, Angel Valley Media", "Ashley Schwartau, 23, graduated from the University of Central Florida's Digital Media program in August of 2008. She has been part of the hacking scene ever since her father, Winn Schwartau, a renowned security expert, took her to DefCon 9, her first hacker convention. Since then, she has grown to love the hacker community, and wanted to do something to give back.
